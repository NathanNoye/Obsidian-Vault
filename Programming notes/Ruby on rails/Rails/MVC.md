## Model
This layer handles the data logic and represents the application's data structure. Models in Rails are typically tied to the database, where each model corresponds to a table in the database. They manage the rules, validations, and relationships of the data. For example, a `User` model in Rails would represent the users' table in the database and define the rules about how user data can be created, stored, and modified.

## View
Views are the user interface of the application. They are responsible for displaying the data to the user and presenting the user interface elements. In Rails, views are often written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an embedded Ruby (ERB) syntax that allows Ruby code to be included in HTML. Views do not contain business logic; they merely present data to the user and handle user input to pass it to the controller.

## Controller
Controllers act as the intermediary between models and views. They process incoming requests, interact with models to access and manipulate the data, and then render a view to display the data to the user. In Rails, controllers are where much of the application logic is placed. For example, when a user requests to see a list of blog posts, the `PostsController` will communicate with the `Post` model to retrieve the data and then render the appropriate view to display the posts.

## Example
Let's create a simple blog example in Ruby on Rails that demonstrates the MVC pattern. In this example, we'll have a `Post` model, views to display posts, and a controller to manage the interaction between the model and views.

- **Model (`Post`)**: Manages the blog post data and business logic.
- **View (`index.html.erb` and `show.html.erb`)**: Presents the data to the user.
- **Controller (`PostsController`)**: Handles the user requests, interacts with the model, and chooses the view to display the data.

### 1. Model: Post

First, we create a `Post` model that will interact with the database. This model represents the posts in the blog. This model ensures that every post has a title and content before it can be saved to the database.

```ruby
# app/models/post.rb
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  validates :title, presence: true
  validates :content, presence: true
end
```

### 2. Controller: PostsController

Next, we create a `PostsController` to handle the logic of fetching and displaying posts. In the `PostsController`, we have two actions:

- `index` action fetches all posts and makes them available to the view.
- `show` action finds a specific post using an ID and makes it available to the view.

```ruby
# app/controllers/posts_controller.rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end

  def show
    @post = Post.find(params[:id])
  end
end
```

### 3. Views
Now, we create views to display the posts.
#### Index View
The index view will display all posts.
```ruby
<!-- app/views/posts/index.html.erb -->
<h1>Blog Posts</h1>
<% @posts.each do |post| %>
  <div>
    <h2><%= link_to post.title, post %></h2>
    <p><%= post.content %></p>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

#### Show View
The show view will display a single post.
```ruby
<!-- app/views/posts/show.html.erb -->
<h1><%= @post.title %></h1>
<p><%= @post.content %></p>
```

### 4. Routes
Lastly, we define the routes for these actions in `config/routes.rb`.
```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :posts, only: [:index, :show]
end
```

This setup defines routes for the `index` and `show` actions of the `PostsController`. When a user accesses `/posts`, they will see the list of all blog posts, and accessing `/posts/:id` will display a specific post.
