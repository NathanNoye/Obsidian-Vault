### Creational patterns
Creational design patterns are focused on handling object creation mechanisms, optimizing the way objects are created, and managing the instantiation process in a system to increase flexibility and efficiency.

1. [[Singleton]]
2. [[Factory Method]]
3. [[Abstract Factory]]
4. [[Builder]]
5. [[Prototype]]

### Structural patterns
Structural design patterns are concerned with how objects and classes are composed to form larger structures. They help ensure that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do the same.

1. [[Adapter]]
2. [[Bridge]]
3. [[Composite]]
4. [[Decorator]]
5. [[Facade]]
6. [[Flyweight]]
7. [[Proxy]]

### Behavioral patterns
Behavioral design patterns are concerned with communication between objects, focusing on how objects interact and distribute responsibility to achieve efficient problem-solving and increase flexibility in the execution of complex tasks.

1. [[Chain of Responsibility]]
2. [[Command]]
3. [[Interpreter]]
4. [[Iterator]]
5. [[Mediator]]
6. [[Memento]]
7. [[Observer]]
8. [[State]]
9. [[Strategy]]
10. [[Template Method]]
11. [[Visitor]]
