**Definition:** **Prototype** is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on their classes.

**Problem it Solves:** The Prototype pattern helps in creating duplicate objects or instances while keeping performance in mind. It allows for copying existing objects without making the code dependent on their classes, thus reducing the overhead of creating objects that are expensive to create from scratch.

**Use Case:** In a document editor, if you need to create a copy of a complex graphic object (like a chart or a diagram) quickly, cloning it would be more efficient than recreating it from scratch.

**TypeScript Example:**
```javascript
interface Prototype {
    clone(): Prototype;
}

class GraphicObject implements Prototype {
    constructor(public type: string, public dimensions: number[]) {}

    clone(): GraphicObject {
        // Creates a shallow copy; for deep copy, you need to clone each property individually
        return new GraphicObject(this.type, [...this.dimensions]);
    }
}

// Usage
const circle = new GraphicObject('Circle', [100, 100]);
const clonedCircle = circle.clone();
console.log(clonedCircle);

```

**Flutter Example**
In Flutter, you typically don't clone widgets because they are immutable and you create new instances. However, you can use the Prototype pattern for data models or other mutable objects.
```dart
abstract class Prototype {
  Prototype clone();
}

class GraphicObject implements Prototype {
  String type;
  List<int> dimensions;

  GraphicObject(this.type, this.dimensions);

  @override
  Prototype clone() {
    return GraphicObject(type, List.from(dimensions));
  }
}

void main() {
  var circle = GraphicObject('Circle', [100, 100]);
  var clonedCircle = circle.clone();
  print(clonedCircle);
}

```

**Pros:**
- Efficient object cloning without going through the standard object creation process, especially when creating complex objects is resource-intensive.
- Reduces the need for subclassing when dealing with predefined object configurations.

**Cons:**
- Cloning complex objects with circular references or complex dependencies can be tricky.
- Requires implementing a cloning mechanism in the target class, which can lead to code duplication if not managed properly.
