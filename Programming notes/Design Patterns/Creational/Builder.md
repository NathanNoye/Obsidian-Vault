**Definition:** Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.

**Problem it Solves:** The Builder pattern addresses the issue of constructing complex objects with numerous configuration options, avoiding a large number of constructor parameters and ensuring readability and maintainability.

**Use Case:** Ideal for constructing complex objects with multiple parts or configurations, like a customizable report or a configurable dialog in an application.

**Pros:**
- Provides clear separation and a step-by-step approach to building complex objects.
- Allows constructing objects with various configurations and optional parts without needing many constructors.
- Encapsulates and isolates complex construction logic from the main business logic.

**Cons:**
- Can lead to overly complex code if the pattern is used for simple objects or if there are too many steps involved.
- Might result in a larger number of classes and interfaces to maintain.

#### Javascript
```javascript
class ReportBuilder {
    private report = { title: '', content: '' };

    setTitle(title: string) {
        this.report.title = title;
        return this;
    }

    setContent(content: string) {
        this.report.content = content;
        return this;
    }

    build() {
        return this.report;
    }
}

const report = new ReportBuilder().setTitle('Annual Report').setContent('Content of the report').build();

```

#### Flutter
```dart
class ReportBuilder {
    String title = '';
    String content = '';

    ReportBuilder setTitle(String title) {
        this.title = title;
        return this;
    }

    ReportBuilder setContent(String content) {
        this.content = content;
        return this;
    }

    Widget build(BuildContext context) {
        return Column(
            children: [
                Text(title, style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
                SizedBox(height: 10),
                Text(content),
            ],
        );
    }
}

// Usage in a Flutter app
Widget reportWidget = ReportBuilder().setTitle('Annual Report').setContent('Content of the report').build(context);

```
