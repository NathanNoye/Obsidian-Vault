Diva's `Database Indexing Is an Art` is a fantastic and insightful read. I liked the "Explain" use case

> **How to validate if my index works?**

| Question             | Answer |
| -------------------- | ------ |
| What's the end goal? |        |
| Example outputs      |        |
| What are the inputs  |        |
| What are the outputs |        |
| Any edge cases       |        |
| Error cases          |        |
