###### 1 
I speak the truth in Christ--I am not lying; my conscience testifies to me through the Holy Spirit-- 

###### 2 
that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. 

###### 3 
For I could wish that I myself were cursed and cut off from Christ for the benefit of my brothers and sisters, my own flesh and blood. 

###### 4 
They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple service, and the promises. 

###### 5 
The ancestors are theirs, and from them, by physical descent, came the Christ, who is God over all, praised forever. Amen.God's Gracious Election of Israel 

###### 6 
Now it is not as though the word of God has failed, because not all who are descended from Israel are Israel. 

###### 7 
Neither is it the case that all of Abraham's children are his descendants. On the contrary, <b class="quote">your offspring will be traced** <b class="quote">through Isaac.** 

###### 8 
That is, it is not the children by physical descent who are God's children, but the children of the promise are considered to be the offspring. 

###### 9 
For this is the statement of the promise: <b class="quote">At this time I will come, and Sarah will have a son.** 

###### 10 
And not only that, but Rebekah conceived children through one man, our father Isaac. 

###### 11 
For though her sons had not been born yet or done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to election might stand-- 

###### 12 
not from works but from the one who calls--she was told, <b class="quote">The older will serve the younger.** 

###### 13 
As it is written: <b class="quote">I have loved Jacob, but I have hated Esau.**God's Selection Is Just 

###### 14 
What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! 

###### 15 
For he tells Moses, <b class="quote">I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.** 

###### 16 
So then, it does not depend on human will or effort but on God who shows mercy. 

###### 17 
For the Scripture tells Pharaoh, <b class="quote">I raised you up for this reason so that I may display my power in you and that my name may be proclaimed in the whole earth.** 

###### 18 
So then, he has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden. 

###### 19 
You will say to me, therefore, "Why then does he still find fault? For who resists his will?" 

###### 20 
On the contrary, who are you, a human being, to talk back to God? Will what is formed say to the one who formed it, "Why did you make me like this?" 

###### 21 
Or has the potter no right over the clay, to make from the same lump one piece of pottery for honor and another for dishonor? 

###### 22 
And what if God, wanting to display his wrath and to make his power known, endured with much patience objects of wrath prepared for destruction? 

###### 23 
And what if he did this to make known the riches of his glory on objects of mercy that he prepared beforehand for glory-- 

###### 24 
on us, the ones he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles? 

###### 25 
As it also says in Hosea, <b class="quote">I will call Not My People, My People,** <b class="quote">and she who is Unloved, Beloved.** 

###### 26 
<b class="quote">And it will be in the place where they were told,** <b class="quote">you are not my people,** <b class="quote">there they will be called sons of the living God.** 

###### 27 
But Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, <b class="quote">Though the number of Israelites** <b class="quote">is like the sand of the sea,** <b class="quote">only the remnant will be saved;** 

###### 28 
<b class="quote">since the Lord will execute his sentence** <b class="quote">completely and decisively on the earth.** 

###### 29 
And just as Isaiah predicted: <b class="quote">If the Lord of Armies had not left us offspring,** <b class="quote">we would have become like Sodom,** <b class="quote">and we would have been made like Gomorrah.**Israel's Present State 

###### 30 
What should we say then? Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have obtained righteousness--namely the righteousness that comes from faith. 

###### 31 
But Israel, pursuing the law of righteousness, has not achieved the righteousness of the law. 

###### 32 
Why is that? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone. 

###### 33 
As it is written, <b class="quote">Look, I am putting a stone in Zion to stumble over** <b class="quote">and a rock to trip over,** <b class="quote">and the one who believes on him** <b class="quote">will not be put to shame.**
