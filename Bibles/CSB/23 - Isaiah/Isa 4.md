###### 1 
On that day seven women will seize one man, saying, "We will eat our own bread and provide our own clothing. Just let us bear your name. Take away our disgrace."Zion's Future Glory 

###### 2 
On that day the Branch of the Lord will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of Israel's survivors. 

###### 3 
Whoever remains in Zion and whoever is left in Jerusalem will be called holy--all in Jerusalem written in the book of life-- 

###### 4 
when the Lord has washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodguilt from the heart of Jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning. 

###### 5 
Then the Lord will create a cloud of smoke by day and a glowing flame of fire by night over the entire site of Mount Zion and over its assemblies. For there will be a canopy over all the glory, 

###### 6 
and there will be a shelter for shade from heat by day and a refuge and shelter from storm and rain.
