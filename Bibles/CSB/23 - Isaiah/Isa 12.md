On that day you will say: "I will give thanks to you, Lord, although you were angry with me. Your anger has turned away, and you have comforted me. 

###### 2 
Indeed, God is my salvation; I will trust him and not be afraid, for the Lord, the Lord himself, is my strength and my song. He has become my salvation." 

###### 3 
You will joyfully draw water from the springs of salvation, 

###### 4

Sing to the Lord, for he has done glorious things. Let this be known throughout the earth. 

###### 6 
Cry out and sing, citizen of Zion, for the Holy One of Israel is among you in his greatness."
