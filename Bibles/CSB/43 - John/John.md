### Key Themes and Content

- **The Divinity of Christ**: John emphasizes Jesus as the incarnate Word of God (Logos), highlighting his divine nature from the very beginning: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1).
- **Signs and Miracles**: The gospel records several miracles or "signs" performed by Jesus, such as turning water into wine at Cana (John 2:1-11) and raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44). These miracles serve to demonstrate Jesus' divine authority and his role as the Messiah.
- **"I Am" Statements**: John features several profound statements by Jesus known as the "I Am" sayings, where Jesus identifies himself with God, using phrases like "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35) and "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). These statements further underscore his divinity and mission.
- **The New Commandment**: Jesus gives a new commandment to his disciples: "Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another" (John 13:34). This command underscores the gospel's focus on love as central to Christian life and belief.
- **The Holy Spirit**: The gospel also speaks extensively about the role of the Holy Spirit, whom Jesus promises to send as an advocate and guide for his followers after his departure (John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15).
- **Eternal Life Through Faith**: A major theme is the offer of eternal life to those who believe in Jesus. John 3:16 succinctly captures this message: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."
