###### 1 
The Lord said to Moses, "I will bring one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that, he will let you go from here. When he lets you go, he will drive you out of here. 

###### 2 
Now announce to the people that both men and women should ask their neighbors for silver and gold items." 

###### 3 
The Lord gave the people favor with the Egyptians. In addition, Moses himself was very highly regarded in the land of Egypt by Pharaoh's officials and the people. 

###### 4 
So Moses said, "This is what the Lord says: About midnight I will go throughout Egypt, 

###### 5 
and every firstborn male in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the servant girl who is at the grindstones, as well as every firstborn of the livestock. 

###### 6 
Then there will be a great cry of anguish through all the land of Egypt such as never was before or ever will be again. 

###### 7 
But against all the Israelites, whether people or animals, not even a dog will snarl, so that you may know that the Lord makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel. 

###### 8 
All these officials of yours will come down to me and bow before me, saying: Get out, you and all the people who follow you. After that, I will get out." And he went out from Pharaoh's presence fiercely angry. 

###### 9 
The Lord said to Moses, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt." 

###### 10 
Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, but the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let the Israelites go out of his land.
