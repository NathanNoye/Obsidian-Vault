###### 1 
Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession. 

###### 2 
He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household. 

###### 3 
For Jesus is considered worthy of more glory than Moses, just as the builder has more honor than the house. 

###### 4 
Now every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God. 

###### 5 
Moses was faithful as a servant in all God's household, as a testimony to what would be said in the future. 

###### 6 
But Christ was faithful as a Son over his household. And we are that household if we hold on to our confidence and the hope in which we boast.Warning against Unbelief 

###### 7 
Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says: <b class="quote">Today, if you hear his voice,** 

###### 8 
<b class="quote">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion,** <b class="quote">on the day of testing in the wilderness,** 

###### 9 
<b class="quote">where your ancestors tested me, tried me**, <b class="quote">and saw my works** 

###### 10 
<b class="quote">for forty years.** <b class="quote">Therefore I was provoked to anger with that generation** <b class="quote">and said, "They always go astray in their hearts,** <b class="quote">and they have not known my ways."** 

###### 11 
<b class="quote">So I swore in my anger,** <b class="quote">"They will not enter my rest."** 

###### 12 
Watch out, brothers and sisters, so that there won't be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that turns away from the living God. 

###### 13 
But encourage each other daily, while it is still called <b class="quote">today**, so that none of you is hardened by sin's deception. 

###### 14 
For we have become participants in Christ if we hold firmly until the end the reality that we had at the start. 

###### 15 
As it is said: <b class="quote">Today, if you hear his voice,** <b class="quote">do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.** 

###### 16 
For who heard and rebelled? Wasn't it all who came out of Egypt under Moses? 

###### 17 
With whom was God angry for forty years? Wasn't it with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 

###### 18 
And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed? 

###### 19 
So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
