###### 3 
I said to her, "You are to live with me many days. You must not be promiscuous or belong to any man, and I will act the same way toward you."

###### 5 
Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come with awe to the Lord and to his goodness in the last days.
