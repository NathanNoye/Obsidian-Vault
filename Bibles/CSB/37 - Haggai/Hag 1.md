###### 1 
In the second year of King Darius, on the first day of the sixth month, the word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest: 

###### 2 
"The Lord of Armies says this: These people say: The time has not come for the house of the Lord to be rebuilt." 

###### 3 
The word of the Lord came through the prophet Haggai: 

###### 4 
"Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?" 

###### 5 
Now, the Lord of Armies says this: "Think carefully about your ways: 

###### 6 
You have planted much but harvested little. You eat but never have enough to be satisfied. You drink but never have enough to be happy. You put on clothes but never have enough to get warm. The wage earner puts his wages into a bag with a hole in it." 

###### 7 
The Lord of Armies says this: "Think carefully about your ways. 

###### 8 
Go up into the hills, bring down lumber, and build the house; and I will be pleased with it and be glorified," says the Lord. 

###### 9 
"You expected much, but then it amounted to little. When you brought the harvest to your house, I ruined it. Why?" This is the declaration of the Lord of Armies. "Because my house still lies in ruins, while each of you is busy with his own house. 

###### 10 
So on your account, the skies have withheld the dew and the land its crops. 

###### 11 
I have summoned a drought on the fields and the hills, on the grain, new wine, fresh oil, and whatever the ground yields, on people and animals, and on all that your hands produce."The People's Response 

###### 12 
Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the entire remnant of the people obeyed the Lord their God and the words of the prophet Haggai, because the Lord their God had sent him. So the people feared the Lord. 

###### 13 
Then Haggai, the Lord's messenger, delivered the Lord's message to the people: "I am with you--this is the Lord's declaration." 

###### 14 
The Lord roused the spirit of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, the spirit of the high priest Joshua son of Jehozadak, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. They began work on the house of the Lord of Armies, their God, 

###### 15 
on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, in the second year of King Darius.
