###### 1 
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. 

###### 2 
After he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. 

###### 3 
Then the tempter approached him and said, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread." 

###### 4 
He answered, **"It is written: <b class="quote">Man must not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.**"** 

###### 5 
Then the devil took him to the holy city, had him stand on the pinnacle of the temple, 

###### 6 
and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written: <b class="quote">He will give his angels** <b class="quote">orders concerning you**, and <b class="quote">they will support you with their hands** <b class="quote">so that you will not strike** <b class="quote">your foot against a stone.**" 

###### 7 
Jesus told him, **"It is also written: <b class="quote">Do not test the Lord your God.**"** 

###### 8 
Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. 

###### 9 
And he said to him, "I will give you all these things if you will fall down and worship me." 

###### 10 
Then Jesus told him, **"Go away,** **Satan! For it is written: <b class="quote">Worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.**"** 

###### 11 
Then the devil left him, and angels came and began to serve him.Ministry in Galilee 

###### 12 
When he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. 

###### 13 
He left Nazareth and went to live in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali. 

###### 14 
This was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah: 

###### 15 
<b class="quote">Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,** <b class="quote">along the road by the sea, beyond the Jordan,** <b class="quote">Galilee of the Gentiles.** 

###### 16 
<b class="quote">The people who live in darkness** <b class="quote">have seen a great light,** <b class="quote">and for those living in the land of the shadow of death,** <b class="quote">a light has dawned.** 

###### 17 
From then on Jesus began to preach, **"Repent, because the kingdom of heaven** **has come near."**The First Disciples 

###### 18 
As he was walking along the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter), and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea--for they were fishermen. 

###### 19 
**"Follow me,"** he told them, **"and I will make you fish for** **people."** 

###### 20 
Immediately they left their nets and followed him. 

###### 21 
Going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with Zebedee their father, preparing their nets, and he called them. 

###### 22 
Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.Teaching, Preaching, and Healing 

###### 23 
Now Jesus began to go all over Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the good news of the kingdom, and healing every disease and sickness among the people. 

###### 24 
Then the news about him spread throughout Syria. So they brought to him all those who were afflicted, those suffering from various diseases and intense pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralytics. And he healed them. 

###### 25 
Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and beyond the Jordan.
