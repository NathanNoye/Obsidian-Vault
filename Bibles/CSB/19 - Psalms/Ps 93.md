***


###### 1 
The Lord reigns! He is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed, enveloped in strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be shaken. 

###### 2 
Your throne has been established from the beginning; you are from eternity. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their pounding waves. 

###### 4 
Greater than the roar of a huge torrent-- the mighty breakers of the sea-- the Lord on high is majestic. 

###### 5 
Lord, your testimonies are completely reliable; holiness adorns your house for all the days to come.
