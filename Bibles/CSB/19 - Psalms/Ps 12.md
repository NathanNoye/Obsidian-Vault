***


###### 1 
Help, Lord, for no faithful one remains; the loyal have disappeared from the human race. 

###### 2 
They lie to one another; they speak with flattering lips and deceptive hearts. 

###### 3 
May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and the tongue that speaks boastfully. 

###### 4 
They say, "Through our tongues we have power; our lips are our own--who can be our master?" 

###### 5 
"Because of the devastation of the needy and the groaning of the poor, I will now rise up," says the Lord. "I will provide safety for the one who longs for it." 

###### 6 
The words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined in an earthen furnace, purified seven times. 

###### 7 
You, Lord, will guard us; you will protect us from this generation forever. 

###### 8 
The wicked prowl all around, and what is worthless is exalted by the human race.
