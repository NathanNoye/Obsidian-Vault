###### 1 
Rescue me, Lord, from evil men. Keep me safe from violent men 

###### 2 
who plan evil in their hearts. They stir up wars all day long. 

###### 3 
They make their tongues as sharp as a snake's bite; viper's venom is under their lips._Selah_ 

###### 4 
Protect me, Lord, from the power of the wicked. Keep me safe from violent men who plan to make me stumble. 

###### 5 
The proud hide a trap with ropes for me; they spread a net along the path and set snares for me._Selah_ 

###### 6 
I say to the Lord, "You are my God." Listen, Lord, to my cry for help. 

###### 7 
Lord, my Lord, my strong Savior, you shield my head on the day of battle. 

###### 8 
Lord, do not grant the desires of the wicked; do not let them achieve their goals. Otherwise, they will become proud._Selah_ 

###### 9 
When those who surround me rise up, may the trouble their lips cause overwhelm them. 

###### 10 
Let hot coals fall on them. Let them be thrown into the fire, into the abyss, never again to rise. 

###### 11 
Do not let a slanderer stay in the land. Let evil relentlessly hunt down a violent man. 

###### 12 
I know that the Lord upholds the just cause of the poor, justice for the needy. 

###### 13 
Surely the righteous will praise your name; the upright will live in your presence.
