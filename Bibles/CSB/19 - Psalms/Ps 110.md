###### 1 
This is the declaration of the Lord to my Lord: "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool." 

###### 2 
The Lord will extend your mighty scepter from Zion. Rule over your surrounding enemies. 

###### 3 
Your people will volunteer on your day of battle. In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn, the dew of your youth belongs to you. 

###### 4 
The Lord has sworn an oath and will not take it back: "You are a priest forever according to the pattern of Melchizedek." 

###### 5 
The Lord is at your right hand; he will crush kings on the day of his anger. 

###### 6 
He will judge the nations, heaping up corpses; he will crush leaders over the entire world. 

###### 7 
He will drink from the brook by the road; therefore, he will lift up his head.
