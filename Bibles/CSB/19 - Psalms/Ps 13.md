***


###### 1 
How long, Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? 

###### 2 
How long will I store up anxious concerns within me, agony in my mind every day? How long will my enemy dominate me? 

###### 3 
Consider me and answer, Lord my God. Restore brightness to my eyes; otherwise, I will sleep in death. 

###### 4 
My enemy will say, "I have triumphed over him," and my foes will rejoice because I am shaken. 

###### 5 
But I have trusted in your faithful love; my heart will rejoice in your deliverance. 

###### 6 
I will sing to the Lord because he has treated me generously.
