***


###### 1 
When Israel came out of Egypt-- the house of Jacob from a people who spoke a foreign language-- 

###### 2 
Judah became his sanctuary, Israel, his dominion. 

###### 3 
The sea looked and fled; the Jordan turned back. 

###### 4 
The mountains skipped like rams, the hills, like lambs. 

###### 5 
Why was it, sea, that you fled? Jordan, that you turned back? 

###### 6 
Mountains, that you skipped like rams? Hills, like lambs? 

###### 7 
Tremble, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

###### 8 
who turned the rock into a pool, the flint into a spring.
