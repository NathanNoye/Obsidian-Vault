# Psalms 142

***


###### 1 
I cry aloud to the Lord; I plead aloud to the Lord for mercy. 

###### 2 
I pour out my complaint before him; I reveal my trouble to him. 

###### 3 
Although my spirit is weak within me, you know my way. Along this path I travel they have hidden a trap for me. 

###### 4 
Look to the right and see: no one stands up for me; there is no refuge for me; no one cares about me. 

###### 5 
I cry to you, Lord; I say, "You are my shelter, my portion in the land of the living." 

###### 6 
Listen to my cry, for I am very weak. Rescue me from those who pursue me, for they are too strong for me. 

###### 7 
Free me from prison so that I can praise your name. The righteous will gather around me because you deal generously with me.
