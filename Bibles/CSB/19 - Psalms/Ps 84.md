###### 1 
How lovely is your dwelling place, Lord of Armies. 

###### 2 
I long and yearn for the courts of the Lord; my heart and flesh cry out for the living God. 

###### 3 
Even a sparrow finds a home, and a swallow, a nest for herself where she places her young-- near your altars, Lord of Armies, my King and my God. 

###### 4 
How happy are those who reside in your house, who praise you continually._Selah_ 

###### 5 
Happy are the people whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage. 

###### 6 
As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a source of spring water; even the autumn rain will cover it with blessings. 

###### 7 
They go from strength to strength; each appears before God in Zion. 

###### 8 
Lord God of Armies, hear my prayer; listen, God of Jacob._Selah_ 

###### 9 
Consider our shield, God; look on the face of your anointed one. 

###### 10 
Better a day in your courts than a thousand anywhere else. I would rather stand at the threshold of the house of my God than live in the tents of wicked people. 

###### 11 
For the Lord God is a sun and shield. The Lord grants favor and honor; he does not withhold the good from those who live with integrity. 

###### 12 
Happy is the person who trusts in you, Lord of Armies!
