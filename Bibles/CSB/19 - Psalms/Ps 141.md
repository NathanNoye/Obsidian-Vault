###### 1 
Lord, I call on you; hurry to help me. Listen to my voice when I call on you. 

###### 2 
May my prayer be set before you as incense, the raising of my hands as the evening offering. 

###### 3 
Lord, set up a guard for my mouth; keep watch at the door of my lips. 

###### 4 
Do not let my heart turn to any evil thing or perform wicked acts with evildoers. Do not let me feast on their delicacies. 

###### 5 
Let the righteous one strike me-- it is an act of faithful love; let him rebuke me-- it is oil for my head; let me not refuse it. Even now my prayer is against the evil acts of the wicked. 

###### 6 
When their rulers will be thrown off the sides of a cliff, the people will listen to my words, for they are pleasing. 

###### 7 
As when one plows and breaks up the soil, turning up rocks, so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol. 

###### 8 
But my eyes look to you, Lord, my Lord. I seek refuge in you; do not let me die. 

###### 9 
Protect me from the trap they have set for me, and from the snares of evildoers. 

###### 10 
Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I pass by safely.
