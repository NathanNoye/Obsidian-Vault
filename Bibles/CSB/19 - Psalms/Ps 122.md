***


###### 1 
I rejoiced with those who said to me, "Let's go to the house of the Lord." 

###### 2 
Our feet were standing within your gates, Jerusalem-- 

###### 3 
Jerusalem, built as a city should be, solidly united, 

###### 4 
where the tribes, the Lord's tribes, go up to give thanks to the name of the Lord. (This is an ordinance for Israel.) 

###### 5 
There, thrones for judgment are placed, thrones of the house of David. 

###### 6 
Pray for the well-being of Jerusalem: "May those who love you be secure; 

###### 7 
may there be peace within your walls, security within your fortresses." 

###### 8 
Because of my brothers and friends, I will say, "May peace be in you." 

###### 9 
Because of the house of the Lord our God, I will pursue your prosperity.
