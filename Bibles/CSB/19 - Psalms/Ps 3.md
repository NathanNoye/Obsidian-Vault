###### 1 
Lord, how my foes increase! There are many who attack me. 

###### 2 
Many say about me, "There is no help for him in God."_Selah_ 

###### 3 
But you, Lord, are a shield around me, my glory, and the one who lifts up my head. 

###### 4 
I cry aloud to the Lord, and he answers me from his holy mountain._Selah_ 

###### 5 
I lie down and sleep; I wake again because the Lord sustains me. 

###### 6 
I will not be afraid of thousands of people who have taken their stand against me on every side. 

###### 7 
Rise up, Lord! Save me, my God! You strike all my enemies on the cheek; you break the teeth of the wicked. 

###### 8 
Salvation belongs to the Lord; may your blessing be on your people._Selah_
