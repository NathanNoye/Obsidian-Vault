###### 1 
Ascribe to the Lord, you heavenly beings, ascribe to the Lord glory and strength. 

###### 2 
Ascribe to the Lord the glory due his name; worship the Lord in the splendor of his holiness. 

###### 3 
The voice of the Lord is above the waters. The God of glory thunders-- the Lord, above the vast water, 

###### 4 
the voice of the Lord in power, the voice of the Lord in splendor. 

###### 5 
The voice of the Lord breaks the cedars; the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon. 

###### 6 
He makes Lebanon skip like a calf, and Sirion, like a young wild ox. 

###### 7 
The voice of the Lord flashes flames of fire. 

###### 8 
The voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness; the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh. 

###### 9 
The voice of the Lord makes the deer give birth and strips the woodlands bare. In his temple all cry, "Glory!" 

###### 10 
The Lord sits enthroned over the flood; the Lord sits enthroned, King forever. 

###### 11 
The Lord gives his people strength; the Lord blesses his people with peace.
