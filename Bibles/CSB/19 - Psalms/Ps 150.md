###### 1 
Hallelujah! Praise God in his sanctuary. Praise him in his mighty expanse. 

###### 2 
Praise him for his powerful acts; praise him for his abundant greatness. 

###### 3 
Praise him with the blast of a ram's horn; praise him with harp and lyre. 

###### 4 
Praise him with tambourine and dance; praise him with strings and flute. 

###### 5 
Praise him with resounding cymbals; praise him with clashing cymbals. 

###### 6 
Let everything that breathes praise the Lord. Hallelujah!
