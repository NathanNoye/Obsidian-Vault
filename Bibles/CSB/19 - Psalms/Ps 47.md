###### 1 
Clap your hands, all you peoples; shout to God with a jubilant cry. 

###### 2 
For the Lord, the Most High, is awe-inspiring, a great King over the whole earth. 

###### 3 
He subdues peoples under us and nations under our feet. 

###### 4 
He chooses for us our inheritance-- the pride of Jacob, whom he loves._Selah_ 

###### 5 
God ascends among shouts of joy, the Lord, with the sound of a ram's horn. 

###### 6 
Sing praise to God, sing praise; sing praise to our King, sing praise! 

###### 7 
Sing a song of wisdom, for God is King of the whole earth. 

###### 8 
God reigns over the nations; God is seated on his holy throne. 

###### 9 
The nobles of the peoples have assembled with the people of the God of Abraham. For the leaders of the earth belong to God; he is greatly exalted.
