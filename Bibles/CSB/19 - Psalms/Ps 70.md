***


###### 1 
God, hurry to rescue me. Lord, hurry to help me! 

###### 2 
Let those who seek to kill me be disgraced and confounded; let those who wish me harm be turned back and humiliated. 

###### 3 
Let those who say, "Aha, aha!" retreat because of their shame. 

###### 4 
Let all who seek you rejoice and be glad in you; let those who love your salvation continually say, "God is great!" 

###### 5 
I am oppressed and needy; hurry to me, God. You are my help and my deliverer; Lord, do not delay.
