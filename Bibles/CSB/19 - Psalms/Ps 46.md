###### 1 
God is our refuge and strength, a helper who is always found in times of trouble. 

###### 2 
Therefore we will not be afraid, though the earth trembles and the mountains topple into the depths of the seas, 

###### 3 
though its water roars and foams and the mountains quake with its turmoil._Selah_ 

###### 4 
There is a river-- its streams delight the city of God, the holy dwelling place of the Most High. 

###### 5 
God is within her; she will not be toppled. God will help her when the morning dawns. 

###### 6 
Nations rage, kingdoms topple; the earth melts when he lifts his voice. 

###### 7 
The Lord of Armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold._Selah_ 

###### 8 
Come, see the works of the Lord, who brings devastation on the earth. 

###### 9 
He makes wars cease throughout the earth. He shatters bows and cuts spears to pieces; he sets wagons ablaze. 

###### 10 
"Stop fighting, and know that I am God, exalted among the nations, exalted on the earth." 

###### 11 
The Lord of Armies is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold._Selah_
