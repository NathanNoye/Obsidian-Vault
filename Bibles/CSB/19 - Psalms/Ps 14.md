***


###### 1 
The fool says in his heart, "There's no God." They are corrupt; they do vile deeds. There is no one who does good. 

###### 2 
The Lord looks down from heaven on the human race to see if there is one who is wise, one who seeks God. 

###### 3 
All have turned away; all alike have become corrupt. There is no one who does good, not even one. 

###### 4 
Will evildoers never understand? They consume my people as they consume bread; they do not call on the Lord. 

###### 5 
Then they will be filled with dread, for God is with those who are righteous. 

###### 6 
You sinners frustrate the plans of the oppressed, but the Lord is his refuge. 

###### 7 
Oh, that Israel's deliverance would come from Zion! When the Lord restores the fortunes of his people, let Jacob rejoice, let Israel be glad.
