***


###### 1 
Answer me when I call, God, who vindicates me. You freed me from affliction; be gracious to me and hear my prayer. 

###### 2 
How long, exalted ones, will my honor be insulted? How long will you love what is worthless and pursue a lie? _Selah_ 

###### 3 
Know that the Lord has set apart the faithful for himself; the Lord will hear when I call to him. 

###### 4 
Be angry and do not sin; reflect in your heart while on your bed and be silent. _Selah_ 

###### 5 
Offer sacrifices in righteousness and trust in the Lord. 

###### 6 
Many are asking, "Who can show us anything good?" Let the light of your face shine on us, Lord. 

###### 7 
You have put more joy in my heart than they have when their grain and new wine abound. 

###### 8 
I will both lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, Lord, make me live in safety.
