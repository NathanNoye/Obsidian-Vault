***


###### 1 
I have taken refuge in the Lord. How can you say to me, "Escape to the mountains like a bird! 

###### 2 
For look, the wicked string bows; they put their arrows on bowstrings to shoot from the shadows at the upright in heart. 

###### 3 
When the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do?" 

###### 4 
The Lord is in his holy temple; the Lord--his throne is in heaven. His eyes watch; his gaze examines everyone. 

###### 5 
The Lord examines the righteous, but he hates the wicked and those who love violence. 

###### 6 
Let him rain burning coals and sulfur on the wicked; let a scorching wind be the portion in their cup. 

###### 7 
For the Lord is righteous; he loves righteous deeds. The upright will see his face.
