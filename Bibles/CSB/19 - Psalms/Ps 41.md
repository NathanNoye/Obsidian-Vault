###### 1 
Happy is one who is considerate of the poor; the Lord will save him in a day of adversity. 

###### 2 
The Lord will keep him and preserve him; he will be blessed in the land. You will not give him over to the desire of his enemies. 

###### 3 
The Lord will sustain him on his sickbed; you will heal him on the bed where he lies. 

###### 4 
I said, "Lord, be gracious to me; heal me, for I have sinned against you." 

###### 5 
My enemies speak maliciously about me: "When will he die and be forgotten?" 

###### 6 
When one of them comes to visit, he speaks deceitfully; he stores up evil in his heart; he goes out and talks. 

###### 7 
All who hate me whisper together about me; they plan to harm me. 

###### 8 
"Something awful has overwhelmed him, and he won't rise again from where he lies!" 

###### 9 
Even my friend in whom I trusted, one who ate my bread, has raised his heel against me. 

###### 10 
But you, Lord, be gracious to me and raise me up; then I will repay them. 

###### 11 
By this I know that you delight in me: my enemy does not shout in triumph over me. 

###### 12 
You supported me because of my integrity and set me in your presence forever. 

###### 13 
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, from everlasting to everlasting. Amen and amen.
