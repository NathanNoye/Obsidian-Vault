###### 1 
How delightfully good when brothers live together in harmony! 

###### 2 
It is like fine oil on the head, running down on the beard, running down Aaron's beard onto his robes. 

###### 3 
It is like the dew of Hermon falling on the mountains of Zion. For there the Lord has appointed the blessing-- life forevermore.
