###### 1 
I will exalt you, Lord, because you have lifted me up and have not allowed my enemies to triumph over me. 

###### 2 
Lord my God, I cried to you for help, and you healed me. 

###### 3 
Lord, you brought me up from Sheol; you spared me from among those going down to the Pit. 

###### 4 
Sing to the Lord, you his faithful ones, and praise his holy name. 

###### 5 
For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor, a lifetime. Weeping may stay overnight, but there is joy in the morning. 

###### 6 
When I was secure, I said, "I will never be shaken." 

###### 7 
Lord, when you showed your favor, you made me stand like a strong mountain; when you hid your face, I was terrified. 

###### 8 
Lord, I called to you; I sought favor from my Lord: 

###### 9 
"What gain is there in my death, if I go down to the Pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your truth? 

###### 10 
Lord, listen and be gracious to me; Lord, be my helper." 

###### 11 
You turned my lament into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with gladness, 

###### 12 
so that I can sing to you and not be silent. Lord my God, I will praise you forever.
