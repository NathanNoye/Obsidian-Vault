###### 1 
Why boast about evil, you hero! God's faithful love is constant. 

###### 2 
Like a sharpened razor, your tongue devises destruction, working treachery. 

###### 3 
You love evil instead of good, lying instead of speaking truthfully._Selah_ 

###### 4 
You love any words that destroy, you treacherous tongue! 

###### 5 
This is why God will bring you down forever. He will take you, ripping you out of your tent; he will uproot you from the land of the living._Selah_ 

###### 6 
The righteous will see and fear, and they will derisively say about that hero, 

###### 7 
"Here is the man who would not make God his refuge, but trusted in the abundance of his riches, taking refuge in his destructive behavior." 

###### 8 
But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God; I trust in God's faithful love forever and ever. 

###### 9 
I will praise you forever for what you have done. In the presence of your faithful people, I will put my hope in your name, for it is good.
