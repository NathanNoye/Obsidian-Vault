###### 1 
Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you. 

###### 2 
I said to the Lord, "You are my Lord; I have nothing good besides you." 

###### 3 
As for the holy people who are in the land, they are the noble ones. All my delight is in them. 

###### 4 
The sorrows of those who take another god for themselves will multiply; I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood, and I will not speak their names with my lips. 

###### 5 
Lord, you are my portion and my cup of blessing; you hold my future. 

###### 6 
The boundary lines have fallen for me in pleasant places; indeed, I have a beautiful inheritance. 

###### 7 
I will bless the Lord who counsels me-- even at night when my thoughts trouble me. 

###### 8 
I always let the Lord guide me. Because he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken. 

###### 9 
Therefore my heart is glad and my whole being rejoices; my body also rests securely. 

###### 10 
For you will not abandon me to Sheol; you will not allow your faithful one to see decay. 

###### 11 
You reveal the path of life to me; in your presence is abundant joy; at your right hand are eternal pleasures.
