###### 1 
God is known in Judah; his name is great in Israel. 

###### 2 
His tent is in Salem, his dwelling place in Zion. 

###### 3 
There he shatters the bow's flaming arrows, the shield, the sword, and the weapons of war._Selah_ 

###### 4 
You are resplendent and majestic coming down from the mountains of prey. 

###### 5 
The brave-hearted have been plundered; they have slipped into their final sleep. None of the warriors was able to lift a hand. 

###### 6 
At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse lay still. 

###### 7 
And you--you are to be feared. When you are angry, who can stand before you? 

###### 8 
From heaven you pronounced judgment. The earth feared and grew quiet 

###### 9 
when God rose up to judge and to save all the lowly of the earth._Selah_ 

###### 10 
Even human wrath will praise you; you will clothe yourself with the wrath that remains. 

###### 11 
Make and keep your vows to the Lord your God; let all who are around him bring tribute to the awe-inspiring one. 

###### 12 
He humbles the spirit of leaders; he is feared by the kings of the earth.
