***


###### 1 
Lord, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I do not get involved with things too great or too wondrous for me. 

###### 2 
Instead, I have calmed and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother; my soul is like a weaned child. 

###### 3 
Israel, put your hope in the Lord, both now and forever.
