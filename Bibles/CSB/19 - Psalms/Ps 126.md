***


###### 1 
When the Lord restored the fortunes of Zion, we were like those who dream. 

###### 2 
Our mouths were filled with laughter then, and our tongues with shouts of joy. Then they said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them." 

###### 3 
The Lord had done great things for us; we were joyful. 

###### 4 
Restore our fortunes, Lord, like watercourses in the Negev. 

###### 5 
Those who sow in tears will reap with shouts of joy. 

###### 6 
Though one goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed, he will surely come back with shouts of joy, carrying his sheaves.
