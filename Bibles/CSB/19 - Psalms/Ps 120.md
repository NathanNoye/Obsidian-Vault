***


###### 1 
In my distress I called to the Lord, and he answered me. 

###### 2 
"Lord, rescue me from lying lips and a deceitful tongue." 

###### 3 
What will he give you, and what will he do to you, you deceitful tongue? 

###### 4 
A warrior's sharp arrows with burning charcoal! 

###### 5 
What misery that I have stayed in Meshech, that I have lived among the tents of Kedar! 

###### 6 
I have dwelt too long with those who hate peace. 

###### 7 
I am for peace; but when I speak, they are for war.
