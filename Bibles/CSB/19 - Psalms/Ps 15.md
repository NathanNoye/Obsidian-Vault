***


###### 1 
Lord, who can dwell in your tent? Who can live on your holy mountain? 

###### 2 
The one who lives blamelessly, practices righteousness, and acknowledges the truth in his heart-- 

###### 3 
who does not slander with his tongue, who does not harm his friend or discredit his neighbor, 

###### 4 
who despises the one rejected by the Lord but honors those who fear the Lord, who keeps his word whatever the cost, 

###### 5 
who does not lend his silver at interest or take a bribe against the innocent-- the one who does these things will never be shaken.
