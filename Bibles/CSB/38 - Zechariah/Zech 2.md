###### 1 
I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 

###### 2 
I asked, "Where are you going?" He answered me, "To measure Jerusalem to determine its width and length." 

###### 3 
Then the angel who was speaking with me went out, and another angel went out to meet him. 

###### 4 
He said to him, "Run and tell this young man: Jerusalem will be inhabited without walls because of the number of people and animals in it." 

###### 5 
The declaration of the Lord: "I myself will be a wall of fire around it, and I will be the glory within it." 

###### 6 
"Listen! Listen! Flee from the land of the north"--this is the Lord's declaration--"for I have scattered you like the four winds of heaven"--this is the Lord's declaration. 

###### 7 
"Listen, Zion! Escape, you who are living with Daughter Babylon." 

###### 8 
For the Lord of Armies says this: "In pursuit of his glory, he sent me against the nations plundering you, for whoever touches you touches the pupil of my eye. 

###### 9 
For look, I am raising my hand against them, and they will become plunder for their own servants. Then you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me. 

###### 10 
"Daughter Zion, shout for joy and be glad, for I am coming to dwell among you"--this is the Lord's declaration. 

###### 11 
"Many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day and become my people. I will dwell among you, and you will know that the Lord of Armies has sent me to you. 

###### 12 
The Lord will take possession of Judah as his portion in the Holy Land, and he will once again choose Jerusalem. 

###### 13 
Let all humanity be silent before the Lord, for from his holy dwelling he has roused himself."
