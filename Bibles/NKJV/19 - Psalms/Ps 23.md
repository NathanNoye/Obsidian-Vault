***


###### 1 
The Lord _is_ my shepherd; I shall not want. 

###### 2 
He makes me to lie down in green pastures; He leads me beside the still waters. 

###### 3 
He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake. 

###### 4 
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; For You _are_ with me; Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me. 

###### 5 
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies; You anoint my head with oil; My cup runs over. 

###### 6 
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days of my life; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord Forever.
