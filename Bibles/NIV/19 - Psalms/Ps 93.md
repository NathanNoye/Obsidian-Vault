###### 1 
The LORD reigns, he is robed in majesty; the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength; indeed, the world is established, firm and secure. 

###### 2 
Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity. 

###### 3 
The seas have lifted up, LORD, the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves. 

###### 4 
Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea-- the LORD on high is mighty. 

###### 5 
Your statutes, LORD, stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek. Copyright © 2019 by Zondervan.
