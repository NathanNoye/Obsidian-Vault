###### 1 
Those who trust in the LORD are like Mount Zion, which cannot be shaken but endures forever. 

###### 2 
As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people both now and forevermore. 

###### 3 
The scepter of the wicked will not remain over the land allotted to the righteous, for then the righteous might use their hands to do evil. 

###### 4 
LORD, do good to those who are good, to those who are upright in heart. 

###### 5 
But those who turn to crooked ways the LORD will banish with the evildoers. Peace be on Israel. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek. Copyright © 2019 by Zondervan.
