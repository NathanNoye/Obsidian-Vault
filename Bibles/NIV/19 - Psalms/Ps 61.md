###### 1 
Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer. 

###### 2 
From the ends of the earth I call to you, I call as my heart grows faint; lead me to the rock that is higher than I. 

###### 3 
For you have been my refuge, a strong tower against the foe. 

###### 4 
I long to dwell in your tent forever and take refuge in the shelter of your wings. 

###### 5 
For you, God, have heard my vows; you have given me the heritage of those who fear your name. 

###### 6 
Increase the days of the king's life, his years for many generations. 

###### 7 
May he be enthroned in God's presence forever; appoint your love and faithfulness to protect him. 

###### 8 
Then I will ever sing in praise of your name and fulfill my vows day after day. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek. Copyright © 2019 by Zondervan.
