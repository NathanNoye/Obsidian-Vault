###### 1 
Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain. Unless the LORD watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain. 

###### 2 
In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat-- for he grants sleep to those he loves. 

###### 3 
Children are a heritage from the LORD, offspring a reward from him. 

###### 4 
Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are children born in one's youth. 

###### 5 
Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their opponents in court. NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek. Copyright © 2019 by Zondervan.
