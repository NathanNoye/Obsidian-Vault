###### 1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite replied: 

###### 2 
"Dominion and awe belong to God; he establishes order in the heights of heaven. 

###### 3 
Can his forces be numbered? On whom does his light not rise? 

###### 4 
How then can a mortal be righteous before God? How can one born of woman be pure? 

###### 5 
If even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes, 

###### 6 
how much less a mortal, who is but a maggot-- a human being, who is only a worm!" NIV Reverse Interlinear Bible: English to Hebrew and English to Greek. Copyright © 2019 by Zondervan.
