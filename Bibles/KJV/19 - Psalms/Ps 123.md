***


###### 1 
Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens. 

###### 2 
Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us. 

###### 3 
Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. 

###### 4 
Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
