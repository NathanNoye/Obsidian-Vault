***


###### 1 
Make haste, o God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD. 

###### 2 
Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt. 

###### 3 
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha. 

###### 4 
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified. 

###### 5 
But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
