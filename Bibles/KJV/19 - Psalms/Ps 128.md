###### 1 
Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways. 

###### 2 
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee. 

###### 3 
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table. 

###### 4 
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD. 

###### 5 
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 

###### 6 
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
