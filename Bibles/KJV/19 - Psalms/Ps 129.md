***


###### 1 
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say: 

###### 2 
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me. 

###### 3 
The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows. 

###### 4 
The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked. 

###### 5 
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion. 

###### 6 
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up: 

###### 7 
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom. 

###### 8 
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
