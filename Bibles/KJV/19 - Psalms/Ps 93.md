###### 1 
The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved. 

###### 2 
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves. 

###### 4 
The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea. 

###### 5 
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
