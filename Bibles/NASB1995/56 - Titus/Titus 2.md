###### 1 
But as for you, speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine. 

###### 2 
Older men are to be temperate, dignified, sensible, sound in faith, in love, in perseverance. 

###### 3 
Older women likewise are to be reverent in their behavior, not malicious gossips nor enslaved to much wine, teaching what is good, 

###### 4 
so that they may encourage the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, 

###### 5 
_to be_ sensible, pure, workers at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the word of God will not be dishonored. 

###### 6 
Likewise urge the young men to be sensible; 

###### 7 
in all things show yourself to be an example of good deeds, _with_ purity in doctrine, dignified, 

###### 8 
sound _in_ speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us. 

###### 9 
_Urge_ bondslaves to be subject to their own masters in everything, to be well-pleasing, not argumentative, 

###### 10 
not pilfering, but showing all good faith so that they will adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in every respect. 

###### 11 
For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, 

###### 12 
instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously and godly in the present age, 

###### 13 
looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, 

###### 14 
who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed, and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds. 

###### 15 
These things speak and exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
