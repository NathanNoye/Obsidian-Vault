###### 18 
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: when His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child by the Holy Spirit. 

###### 19 
And Joseph her husband, being a righteous man and not wanting to disgrace her, planned to send her away secretly. 

###### 20 
But when he had considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife; for the Child who has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. 

###### 21 
She will bear a Son; and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." 

###### 22 
Now all this took place to fulfill what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet: 

###### 23 
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel," which translated means, "God with us." 

###### 24 
And Joseph awoke from his sleep and did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took _Mary_ as his wife, 

###### 25 
but kept her a virgin until she gave birth to a Son; and he called His name Jesus.
