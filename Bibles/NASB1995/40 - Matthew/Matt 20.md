###### 1 
"For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. 

###### 2 
When he had agreed with the laborers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard. 

###### 3 
And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle in the market place; 

###### 4 
and to those he said, 'You also go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.' And _so_ they went. 

###### 5 
Again he went out about the sixth and the ninth hour, and did the same thing. 

###### 6 
And about the eleventh _hour_ he went out and found others standing _around_; and he *said to them, 'Why have you been standing here idle all day long?' 

###### 7 
They *said to him, 'Because no one hired us.' He *said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' 

###### 8 
"When evening came, the owner of the vineyard *said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last _group_ to the first.' 

###### 9 
When those _hired_ about the eleventh hour came, each one received a denarius. 

###### 10 
When those _hired_ first came, they thought that they would receive more; but each of them also received a denarius. 

###### 11 
When they received it, they grumbled at the landowner, 

###### 12 
saying, 'These last men have worked _only_ one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden and the scorching heat of the day.' 

###### 13 
But he answered and said to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? 

###### 14 
Take what is yours and go, but I wish to give to this last man the same as to you. 

###### 15 
Is it not lawful for me to do what I wish with what is my own? Or is your eye envious because I am generous?' 

###### 16 
So the last shall be first, and the first last."Death, Resurrection Foretold 

###### 17 
As Jesus was about to go up to Jerusalem, He took the twelve _disciples_ aside by themselves, and on the way He said to them, 

###### 18 
"Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man will be delivered to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn Him to death, 

###### 19 
and will hand Him over to the Gentiles to mock and scourge and crucify _Him_, and on the third day He will be raised up."Preferment Asked 

###### 20 
Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons, bowing down and making a request of Him. 

###### 21 
And He said to her, **"What do you wish?"** She *said to Him, "Command that in Your kingdom these two sons of mine may sit one on Your right and one on Your left." 

###### 22 
But Jesus answered, **"You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink?"** They *said to Him, "We are able." 

###### 23 
He *said to them, **"My cup you shall drink; but to sit on My right and on _My_ left, this is not Mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by My Father."** 

###### 24 
And hearing _this_, the ten became indignant with the two brothers. 

###### 25 
But Jesus called them to Himself and said, **"You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and _their_ great men exercise authority over them.** 

###### 26 
It is not this way among you, but whoever wishes to become great among you shall be your servant, 

###### 27 
and whoever wishes to be first among you shall be your slave; 

###### 28 
just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many."Sight for the Blind 

###### 29 
As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Him. 

###### 30 
And two blind men sitting by the road, hearing that Jesus was passing by, cried out, "Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David!" 

###### 31 
The crowd sternly told them to be quiet, but they cried out all the more, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!" 

###### 32 
And Jesus stopped and called them, and said, **"What do you want Me to do for you?"** 

###### 33 
They *said to Him, "Lord, _we want_ our eyes to be opened." 

###### 34 
Moved with compassion, Jesus touched their eyes; and immediately they regained their sight and followed Him.
