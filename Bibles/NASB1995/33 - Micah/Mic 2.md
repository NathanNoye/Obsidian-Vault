###### 1 
Woe to those who scheme iniquity, Who work out evil on their beds! When morning comes, they do it, For it is in the power of their hands. 

###### 2 
They covet fields and then seize _them_, And houses, and take _them_ away. They rob a man and his house, A man and his inheritance. 

###### 3 
Therefore thus says the LORD, "Behold, I am planning against this family a calamity From which you cannot remove your necks; And you will not walk haughtily, For it will be an evil time. 

###### 4 
"On that day they will take up against you a taunt And utter a bitter lamentation _and_ say, 'We are completely destroyed! He exchanges the portion of my people; How He removes it from me! To the apostate He apportions our fields.' 

###### 5 
"Therefore you will have no one stretching a measuring line For you by lot in the assembly of the LORD. 

###### 6 
'Do not speak out,' _so_ they speak out. _But if_ they do not speak out concerning these things, Reproaches will not be turned back. 

###### 7 
"Is it being said, O house of Jacob: 'Is the Spirit of the LORD impatient? Are these His doings?' Do not My words do good To the one walking uprightly? 

###### 8 
"Recently My people have arisen as an enemy-- You strip the robe off the garment From unsuspecting passers-by, _From_ those returned from war. 

###### 9 
"The women of My people you evict, Each _one_ from her pleasant house. From her children you take My splendor forever. 

###### 10 
"Arise and go, For this is no place of rest Because of the uncleanness that brings on destruction, A painful destruction. 

###### 11 
"If a man walking after wind and falsehood Had told lies _and said_, 'I will speak out to you concerning wine and liquor,' He would be spokesman to this people. 

###### 12 
"I will surely assemble all of you, Jacob, I will surely gather the remnant of Israel. I will put them together like sheep in the fold; Like a flock in the midst of its pasture They will be noisy with men. 

###### 13 
"The breaker goes up before them; They break out, pass through the gate and go out by it. So their king goes on before them, And the LORD at their head."
