###### 1 
Then Bildad the Shuhite answered, 

###### 2 
"Dominion and awe belong to Him Who establishes peace in His heights. 

###### 3 
"Is there any number to His troops? And upon whom does His light not rise? 

###### 4 
"How then can a man be just with God? Or how can he be clean who is born of woman? 

###### 5 
"If even the moon has no brightness And the stars are not pure in His sight, 

###### 6 
How much less man, _that_ maggot, And the son of man, _that_ worm!"
