###### 1 
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, 

###### 2 
"Therefore my disquieting thoughts make me respond, Even because of my inward agitation. 

###### 3 
"I listened to the reproof which insults me, And the spirit of my understanding makes me answer. 

###### 4 
"Do you know this from of old, From the establishment of man on earth, 

###### 5 
That the triumphing of the wicked is short, And the joy of the godless momentary? 

###### 6 
"Though his loftiness reaches the heavens, And his head touches the clouds, 

###### 7 
He perishes forever like his refuse; Those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' 

###### 8 
"He flies away like a dream, and they cannot find him; Even like a vision of the night he is chased away. 

###### 9 
"The eye which saw him sees him no longer, And his place no longer beholds him. 

###### 10 
"His sons favor the poor, And his hands give back his wealth. 

###### 11 
"His bones are full of his youthful vigor, But it lies down with him in the dust. 

###### 12 
"Though evil is sweet in his mouth _And_ he hides it under his tongue, 

###### 13 
_Though_ he desires it and will not let it go, But holds it in his mouth, 

###### 14 
_Yet_ his food in his stomach is changed To the venom of cobras within him. 

###### 15 
"He swallows riches, But will vomit them up; God will expel them from his belly. 

###### 16 
"He sucks the poison of cobras; The viper's tongue slays him. 

###### 17 
"He does not look at the streams, The rivers flowing with honey and curds. 

###### 18 
"He returns what he has attained And cannot swallow _it_; As to the riches of his trading, He cannot even enjoy _them_. 

###### 19 
"For he has oppressed _and_ forsaken the poor; He has seized a house which he has not built. 

###### 20 
"Because he knew no quiet within him, He does not retain anything he desires. 

###### 21 
"Nothing remains for him to devour, Therefore his prosperity does not endure. 

###### 22 
"In the fullness of his plenty he will be cramped; The hand of everyone who suffers will come _against_ him. 

###### 23 
"When he fills his belly, _God_ will send His fierce anger on him And will rain _it_ on him while he is eating. 

###### 24 
"He may flee from the iron weapon, _But_ the bronze bow will pierce him. 

###### 25 
"It is drawn forth and comes out of his back, Even the glittering point from his gall. Terrors come upon him, 

###### 26 
Complete darkness is held in reserve for his treasures, And unfanned fire will devour him; It will consume the survivor in his tent. 

###### 27 
"The heavens will reveal his iniquity, And the earth will rise up against him. 

###### 28 
"The increase of his house will depart; _His possessions_ will flow away in the day of His anger. 

###### 29 
"This is the wicked man's portion from God, Even the heritage decreed to him by God."
