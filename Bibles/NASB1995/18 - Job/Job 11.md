###### 1 
Then Zophar the Naamathite answered, 

###### 2 
"Shall a multitude of words go unanswered, And a talkative man be acquitted? 

###### 3 
"Shall your boasts silence men? And shall you scoff and none rebuke? 

###### 4 
"For you have said, 'My teaching is pure, And I am innocent in your eyes.' 

###### 5 
"But would that God might speak, And open His lips against you, 

###### 6 
And show you the secrets of wisdom! For sound wisdom has two sides. Know then that God forgets a part of your iniquity. 

###### 7 
"Can you discover the depths of God? Can you discover the limits of the Almighty? 

###### 8 
"_They are_ high as the heavens, what can you do? Deeper than Sheol, what can you know? 

###### 9 
"Its measure is longer than the earth And broader than the sea. 

###### 10 
"If He passes by or shuts up, Or calls an assembly, who can restrain Him? 

###### 11 
"For He knows false men, And He sees iniquity without investigating. 

###### 12 
"An idiot will become intelligent When the foal of a wild donkey is born a man. 

###### 13 
"If you would direct your heart right And spread out your hand to Him, 

###### 14 
If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, And do not let wickedness dwell in your tents; 

###### 15 
"Then, indeed, you could lift up your face without _moral_ defect, And you would be steadfast and not fear. 

###### 16 
"For you would forget _your_ trouble, As waters that have passed by, you would remember _it_. 

###### 17 
"Your life would be brighter than noonday; Darkness would be like the morning. 

###### 18 
"Then you would trust, because there is hope; And you would look around and rest securely. 

###### 19 
"You would lie down and none would disturb _you_, And many would entreat your favor. 

###### 20 
"But the eyes of the wicked will fail, And there will be no escape for them; And their hope is to breathe their last."
