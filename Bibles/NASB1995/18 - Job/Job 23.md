###### 1 
Then Job replied, 

###### 2 
"Even today my complaint is rebellion; His hand is heavy despite my groaning. 

###### 3 
"Oh that I knew where I might find Him, That I might come to His seat! 

###### 4 
"I would present _my_ case before Him And fill my mouth with arguments. 

###### 5 
"I would learn the words _which_ He would answer, And perceive what He would say to me. 

###### 6 
"Would He contend with me by the greatness of _His_ power? No, surely He would pay attention to me. 

###### 7 
"There the upright would reason with Him; And I would be delivered forever from my Judge. 

###### 8 
"Behold, I go forward but He is not _there_, And backward, but I cannot perceive Him; 

###### 9 
When He acts on the left, I cannot behold _Him_; He turns on the right, I cannot see Him. 

###### 10 
"But He knows the way I take; _When_ He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 

###### 11 
"My foot has held fast to His path; I have kept His way and not turned aside. 

###### 12 
"I have not departed from the command of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food. 

###### 13 
"But He is unique and who can turn Him? And _what_ His soul desires, that He does. 

###### 14 
"For He performs what is appointed for me, And many such _decrees_ are with Him. 

###### 15 
"Therefore, I would be dismayed at His presence; _When_ I consider, I am terrified of Him. 

###### 16 
"_It is_ God _who_ has made my heart faint, And the Almighty _who_ has dismayed me, 

###### 17 
But I am not silenced by the darkness, Nor deep gloom _which_ covers me.
