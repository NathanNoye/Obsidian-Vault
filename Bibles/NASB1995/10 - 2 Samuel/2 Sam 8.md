###### 1 
Now after this it came about that David defeated the Philistines and subdued them; and David took control of the chief city from the hand of the Philistines. 

###### 2 
He defeated Moab, and measured them with the line, making them lie down on the ground; and he measured two lines to put to death and one full line to keep alive. And the Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute. 

###### 3 
Then David defeated Hadadezer, the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to restore his rule at the River. 

###### 4 
David captured from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers; and David hamstrung the chariot horses, but reserved _enough_ of them for 100 chariots. 

###### 5 
When the Arameans of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David killed 22,000 Arameans. 

###### 6 
Then David put garrisons among the Arameans of Damascus, and the Arameans became servants to David, bringing tribute. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. 

###### 7 
David took the shields of gold which were carried by the servants of Hadadezer and brought them to Jerusalem. 

###### 8 
From Betah and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took a very large amount of bronze. 

###### 9 
Now when Toi king of Hamath heard that David had defeated all the army of Hadadezer, 

###### 10 
Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet him and bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer and defeated him; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. And _Joram_ brought with him articles of silver, of gold and of bronze. 

###### 11 
King David also dedicated these to the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he had subdued: 

###### 12 
from Aram and Moab and the sons of Ammon and the Philistines and Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah. 

###### 13 
So David made a name _for himself_ when he returned from killing 18,000 Arameans in the Valley of Salt. 

###### 14 
He put garrisons in Edom. In all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped David wherever he went. 

###### 15 
So David reigned over all Israel; and David administered justice and righteousness for all his people. 

###### 16 
Joab the son of Zeruiah _was_ over the army, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud _was_ recorder. 

###### 17 
Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar _were_ priests, and Seraiah _was_ secretary. 

###### 18 
Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief ministers.
