###### 1 
Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but _rather_ appeal to _him_ as a father, _to_ the younger men as brothers, 

###### 2 
the older women as mothers, _and_ the younger women as sisters, in all purity. 

###### 3 
Honor widows who are widows indeed; 

###### 4 
but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to practice piety in regard to their own family and to make some return to their parents; for this is acceptable in the sight of God. 

###### 5 
Now she who is a widow indeed and who has been left alone, has fixed her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day. 

###### 6 
But she who gives herself to wanton pleasure is dead even while she lives. 

###### 7 
Prescribe these things as well, so that they may be above reproach. 

###### 8 
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. 

###### 9 
A widow is to be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, _having been_ the wife of one man, 

###### 10 
having a reputation for good works; _and_ if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has assisted those in distress, _and_ if she has devoted herself to every good work. 

###### 11 
But refuse _to put_ younger widows _on the list_, for when they feel sensual desires in disregard of Christ, they want to get married, 

###### 12 
_thus_ incurring condemnation, because they have set aside their previous pledge. 

###### 13 
At the same time they also learn _to be_ idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper _to mention_. 

###### 14 
Therefore, I want younger _widows_ to get married, bear children, keep house, _and_ give the enemy no occasion for reproach; 

###### 15 
for some have already turned aside to follow Satan. 

###### 16 
If any woman who is a believer has _dependent_ widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may assist those who are widows indeed.Concerning Elders 

###### 17 
The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching. 

###### 18 
For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing," and "The laborer is worthy of his wages." 

###### 19 
Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the basis of two or three witnesses. 

###### 20 
Those who continue in sin, rebuke in the presence of all, so that the rest also will be fearful _of sinning_. 

###### 21 
I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of _His_ chosen angels, to maintain these _principles_ without bias, doing nothing in a _spirit of_ partiality. 

###### 22 
Do not lay hands upon anyone _too_ hastily and thereby share _responsibility for_ the sins of others; keep yourself free from sin. 

###### 23 
No longer drink water _exclusively_, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments. 

###### 24 
The sins of some men are quite evident, going before them to judgment; for others, their _sins_ follow after. 

###### 25 
Likewise also, deeds that are good are quite evident, and those which are otherwise cannot be concealed.
