###### 1 
But realize this, that in the last days difficult times will come. 

###### 2 
For men will be lovers of self, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, 

###### 3 
unloving, irreconcilable, malicious gossips, without self-control, brutal, haters of good, 

###### 4 
treacherous, reckless, conceited, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 

###### 5 
holding to a form of godliness, although they have denied its power; Avoid such men as these. 

###### 6 
For among them are those who enter into households and captivate weak women weighed down with sins, led on by various impulses, 

###### 7 
always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. 

###### 8 
Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these _men_ also oppose the truth, men of depraved mind, rejected in regard to the faith. 

###### 9 
But they will not make further progress; for their folly will be obvious to all, just as Jannes's and Jambres's folly was also. 

###### 10 
Now you followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, patience, love, perseverance, 

###### 11 
persecutions, _and_ sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium _and_ at Lystra; what persecutions I endured, and out of them all the Lord rescued me! 

###### 12 
Indeed, all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. 

###### 13 
But evil men and impostors will proceed _from bad_ to worse, deceiving and being deceived. 

###### 14 
You, however, continue in the things you have learned and become convinced of, knowing from whom you have learned _them_, 

###### 15 
and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings which are able to give you the wisdom that leads to salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. 

###### 16 
All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; 

###### 17 
so that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.
