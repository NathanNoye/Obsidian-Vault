###### 1 
I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience testifies with me in the Holy Spirit, 

###### 2 
that I have great sorrow and unceasing grief in my heart. 

###### 3 
For I could wish that I myself were accursed, _separated_ from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, 

###### 4 
who are Israelites, to whom belongs the adoption as sons, and the glory and the covenants and the giving of the Law and the _temple_ service and the promises, 

###### 5 
whose are the fathers, and from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen. 

###### 6 
But _it is_ not as though the word of God has failed. For they are not all Israel who are _descended_ from Israel; 

###### 7 
nor are they all children because they are Abraham's descendants, but: "through Isaac your descendants will be named." 

###### 8 
That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants. 

###### 9 
For this is the word of promise: "At this time I will come, and Sarah shall have a son." 

###### 10 
And not only this, but there was Rebekah also, when she had conceived _twins_ by one man, our father Isaac; 

###### 11 
for though _the twins_ were not yet born and had not done anything good or bad, so that God's purpose according to _His_ choice would stand, not because of works but because of Him who calls, 

###### 12 
it was said to her, "The older will serve the younger." 

###### 13 
Just as it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated." 

###### 14 
What shall we say then? There is no injustice with God, is there? May it never be! 

###### 15 
For He says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion." 

###### 16 
So then it _does_ not _depend_ on the man who wills or the man who runs, but on God who has mercy. 

###### 17 
For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up, to demonstrate My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth." 

###### 18 
So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires. 

###### 19 
You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who resists His will?" 

###### 20 
On the contrary, who are you, O man, who answers back to God? The thing molded will not say to the molder, "Why did you make me like this," will it? 

###### 21 
Or does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use? 

###### 22 
What if God, although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction? 

###### 23 
And _He did so_ to make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He prepared beforehand for glory, 

###### 24 
_even_ us, whom He also called, not from among Jews only, but also from among Gentiles. 

###### 25 
As He says also in Hosea, "I will call those who were not My people, 'My people,' And her who was not beloved, 'beloved.'" 

###### 26 
"And it shall be that in the place where it was said to them, 'you are not My people,' There they shall be called sons of the living God." 

###### 27 
Isaiah cries out concerning Israel, "Though the number of the sons of Israel be like the sand of the sea, it is the remnant that will be saved; 

###### 28 
for the Lord will execute His word on the earth, thoroughly and quickly." 

###### 29 
And just as Isaiah foretold, "Unless the Lord of Sabaoth had left to us a posterity, We would have become like Sodom, and would have resembled Gomorrah." 

###### 30 
What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, attained righteousness, even the righteousness which is by faith; 

###### 31 
but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not arrive at _that_ law. 

###### 32 
Why? Because _they did_ not _pursue it_ by faith, but as though _it were_ by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, 

###### 33 
just as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, And he who believes in Him will not be disappointed."
