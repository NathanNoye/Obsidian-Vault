###### 1 
Brethren, my heart's desire and my prayer to God for them is for _their_ salvation. 

###### 2 
For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge. 

###### 3 
For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God. 

###### 4 
For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. 

###### 5 
For Moses writes that the man who practices the righteousness which is based on law shall live by that righteousness. 

###### 6 
But the righteousness based on faith speaks as follows: "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?' (that is, to bring Christ down), 

###### 7 
or 'Who will descend into the abyss?' (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead)." 

###### 8 
But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"--that is, the word of faith which we are preaching, 

###### 9 
that if you confess with your mouth Jesus _as_ Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved; 

###### 10 
for with the heart a person believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth he confesses, resulting in salvation. 

###### 11 
For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes in Him will not be disappointed." 

###### 12 
For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same _Lord_ is Lord of all, abounding in riches for all who call on Him; 

###### 13 
for "Whoever will call on the name of the Lord will be saved." 

###### 14 
How then will they call on Him in whom they have not believed? How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 

###### 15 
How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news of good things!" 

###### 16 
However, they did not all heed the good news; for Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?" 

###### 17 
So faith _comes_ from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ. 

###### 18 
But I say, surely they have never heard, have they? Indeed they have; "Their voice has gone out into all the earth, And their words to the ends of the world." 

###### 19 
But I say, surely Israel did not know, did they? First Moses says, "I will make you jealous by that which is not a nation, By a nation without understanding will I anger you." 

###### 20 
And Isaiah is very bold and says, "I was found by those who did not seek Me, I became manifest to those who did not ask for Me." 

###### 21 
But as for Israel He says, "All the day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."
