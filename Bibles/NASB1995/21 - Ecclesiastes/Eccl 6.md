###### 1 
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun and it is prevalent among men-- 

###### 2 
a man to whom God has given riches and wealth and honor so that his soul lacks nothing of all that he desires; yet God has not empowered him to eat from them, for a foreigner enjoys them. This is vanity and a severe affliction. 

###### 3 
If a man fathers a hundred _children_ and lives many years, however many they be, but his soul is not satisfied with good things and he does not even have a _proper_ burial, _then_ I say, "Better the miscarriage than he, 

###### 4 
for it comes in futility and goes into obscurity; and its name is covered in obscurity. 

###### 5 
It never sees the sun and it never knows _anything_; it is better off than he. 

###### 6 
Even if the _other_ man lives a thousand years twice and does not enjoy good things--do not all go to one place?" 

###### 7 
All a man's labor is for his mouth and yet the appetite is not satisfied. 

###### 8 
For what advantage does the wise man have over the fool? What _advantage_ does the poor man have, knowing _how_ to walk before the living? 

###### 9 
What the eyes see is better than what the soul desires. This too is futility and a striving after wind. 

###### 10 
Whatever exists has already been named, and it is known what man is; for he cannot dispute with him who is stronger than he is. 

###### 11 
For there are many words which increase futility. What _then_ is the advantage to a man? 

###### 12 
For who knows what is good for a man during _his_ lifetime, _during_ the few years of his futile life? He will spend them like a shadow. For who can tell a man what will be after him under the sun?
