###### 1 
Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the Apostle and High Priest of our confession; 

###### 2 
He was faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was in all His house. 

###### 3 
For He has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by just so much as the builder of the house has more honor than the house. 

###### 4 
For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. 

###### 5 
Now Moses was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken later; 

###### 6 
but Christ _was faithful_ as a Son over His house--whose house we are, if we hold fast our confidence and the boast of our hope firm until the end. 

###### 7 
Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says, "Today if you hear His voice, 

###### 8 
Do not harden your hearts as when they provoked Me, As in the day of trial in the wilderness, 

###### 9 
Where your fathers tried _Me_ by testing _Me_, And saw My works for forty years. 

###### 10 
"Therefore I was angry with this generation, And said, 'They always go astray in their heart, And they did not know My ways'; 

###### 11 
As I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.'"The Peril of Unbelief 

###### 12 
Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God. 

###### 13 
But encourage one another day after day, as long as it is _still_ called "Today," so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 

###### 14 
For we have become partakers of Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our assurance firm until the end, 

###### 15 
while it is said, "Today if you hear His voice, Do not harden your hearts, as when they provoked Me." 

###### 16 
For who provoked _Him_ when they had heard? Indeed, did not all those who came out of Egypt _led_ by Moses? 

###### 17 
And with whom was He angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 

###### 18 
And to whom did He swear that they would not enter His rest, but to those who were disobedient? 

###### 19 
_So_ we see that they were not able to enter because of unbelief.
