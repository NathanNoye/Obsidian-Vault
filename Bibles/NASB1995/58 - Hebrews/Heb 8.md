###### 1 
Now the main point in what has been said _is this_: we have such a high priest, who has taken His seat at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 

###### 2 
a minister in the sanctuary and in the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, not man. 

###### 3 
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; so it is necessary that this _high priest_ also have something to offer. 

###### 4 
Now if He were on earth, He would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the Law; 

###### 5 
who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses was warned _by God_ when he was about to erect the tabernacle; for, "See," He says, "that you make all things according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain." 

###### 6 
But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, by as much as He is also the mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted on better promises.A New Covenant 

###### 7 
For if that first _covenant_ had been faultless, there would have been no occasion sought for a second. 

###### 8 
For finding fault with them, He says, "Behold, days are coming, says the Lord, When I will effect a new covenant With the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; 

###### 9 
Not like the covenant which I made with their fathers On the day when I took them by the hand To lead them out of the land of Egypt; For they did not continue in My covenant, And I did not care for them, says the Lord. 

###### 10 
"For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel After those days, says the Lord: I will put My laws into their minds, And I will write them on their hearts. And I will be their God, And they shall be My people. 

###### 11 
"And they shall not teach everyone his fellow citizen, And everyone his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' For all will know Me, From the least to the greatest of them. 

###### 12 
"For I will be merciful to their iniquities, And I will remember their sins no more." 

###### 13 
When He said, "A new _covenant_," He has made the first obsolete. But whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to disappear.
