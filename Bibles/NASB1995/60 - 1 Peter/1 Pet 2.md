###### 1 
Therefore, putting aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, 

###### 2 
like newborn babies, long for the pure milk of the word, so that by it you may grow in respect to salvation, 

###### 3 
if you have tasted the kindness of the Lord.As Living Stones 

###### 4 
And coming to Him as to a living stone which has been rejected by men, but is choice and precious in the sight of God, 

###### 5 
you also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house for a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 

###### 6 
For _this_ is contained in Scripture: "Behold, I lay in Zion a choice stone, a precious corner _stone_, And he who believes in Him will not be disappointed." 

###### 7 
This precious value, then, is for you who believe; but for those who disbelieve, "The stone which the builders rejected, This became the very corner _stone_," 

###### 8 
and, "A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense"; for they stumble because they are disobedient to the word, and to this _doom_ they were also appointed. 

###### 9 
But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for _God's_ own possession, so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who has called you out of darkness into His marvelous light; 

###### 10 
for you once were not a people, but now you are the people of God; you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. 

###### 11 
Beloved, I urge you as aliens and strangers to abstain from fleshly lusts which wage war against the soul. 

###### 12 
Keep your behavior excellent among the Gentiles, so that in the thing in which they slander you as evildoers, they may because of your good deeds, as they observe _them_, glorify God in the day of visitation.Honor Authority 

###### 13 
Submit yourselves for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether to a king as the one in authority, 

###### 14 
or to governors as sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do right. 

###### 15 
For such is the will of God that by doing right you may silence the ignorance of foolish men. 

###### 16 
_Act_ as free men, and do not use your freedom as a covering for evil, but _use it_ as bondslaves of God. 

###### 17 
Honor all people, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the king. 

###### 18 
Servants, be submissive to your masters with all respect, not only to those who are good and gentle, but also to those who are unreasonable. 

###### 19 
For this _finds_ favor, if for the sake of conscience toward God a person bears up under sorrows when suffering unjustly. 

###### 20 
For what credit is there if, when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience? But if when you do what is right and suffer _for it_ you patiently endure it, this _finds_ favor with God.Christ Is Our Example 

###### 21 
For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example for you to follow in His steps, 

###### 22 
who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in His mouth; 

###### 23 
and while being reviled, He did not revile in return; while suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting _Himself_ to Him who judges righteously; 

###### 24 
and He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness; for by His wounds you were healed. 

###### 25 
For you were continually straying like sheep, but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls.
