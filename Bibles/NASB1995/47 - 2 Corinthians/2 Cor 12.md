###### 1 
Boasting is necessary, though it is not profitable; but I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord. 

###### 2 
I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago--whether in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows--such a man was caught up to the third heaven. 

###### 3 
And I know how such a man--whether in the body or apart from the body I do not know, God knows-- 

###### 4 
was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible words, which a man is not permitted to speak. 

###### 5 
On behalf of such a man I will boast; but on my own behalf I will not boast, except in regard to _my_ weaknesses. 

###### 6 
For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I will be speaking the truth; but I refrain _from this_, so that no one will credit me with more than he sees _in_ me or hears from me.A Thorn in the Flesh 

###### 7 
Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, for this reason, to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me--to keep me from exalting myself! 

###### 8 
Concerning this I implored the Lord three times that it might leave me. 

###### 9 
And He has said to me, **"My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness."** Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. 

###### 10 
Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ's sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong. 

###### 11 
I have become foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, for in no respect was I inferior to the most eminent apostles, even though I am a nobody. 

###### 12 
The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with all perseverance, by signs and wonders and miracles. 

###### 13 
For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not become a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong! 

###### 14 
Here for this third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you; for children are not responsible to save up for _their_ parents, but parents for _their_ children. 

###### 15 
I will most gladly spend and be expended for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less? 

###### 16 
But be that as it may, I did not burden you myself; nevertheless, crafty fellow that I am, I took you in by deceit. 

###### 17 
_Certainly_ I have not taken advantage of you through any of those whom I have sent to you, have I? 

###### 18 
I urged Titus _to go_, and I sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit _and walk_ in the same steps? 

###### 19 
All this time you have been thinking that we are defending ourselves to you. _Actually_, it is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ; and all for your upbuilding, beloved. 

###### 20 
For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you to be not what I wish and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps _there will be_ strife, jealousy, angry tempers, disputes, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances; 

###### 21 
I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not repented of the impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced.
