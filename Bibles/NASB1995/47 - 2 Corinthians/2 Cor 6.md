###### 1 
And working together _with Him_, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain-- 

###### 2 
for He says, "At the acceptable time I listened to you, And on the day of salvation I helped you." Behold, now is "the acceptable time," behold, now is "the day of salvation"-- 

###### 3 
giving no cause for offense in anything, so that the ministry will not be discredited, 

###### 4 
but in everything commending ourselves as servants of God, in much endurance, in afflictions, in hardships, in distresses, 

###### 5 
in beatings, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labors, in sleeplessness, in hunger, 

###### 6 
in purity, in knowledge, in patience, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in genuine love, 

###### 7 
in the word of truth, in the power of God; by the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and the left, 

###### 8 
by glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report; _regarded_ as deceivers and yet true; 

###### 9 
as unknown yet well-known, as dying yet behold, we live; as punished yet not put to death, 

###### 10 
as sorrowful yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich, as having nothing yet possessing all things. 

###### 11 
Our mouth has spoken freely to you, O Corinthians, our heart is opened wide. 

###### 12 
You are not restrained by us, but you are restrained in your own affections. 

###### 13 
Now in a like exchange--I speak as to children--open wide _to us_ also. 

###### 14 
Do not be bound together with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness? 

###### 15 
Or what harmony has Christ with Belial, or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? 

###### 16 
Or what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; just as God said, "I will dwell in them and walk among them; And I will be their God, and they shall be My people. 

###### 17 
"Therefore, come out from their midst and be separate," says the Lord. "And do not touch what is unclean; And I will welcome you. 

###### 18 
"And I will be a father to you, And you shall be sons and daughters to Me," Says the Lord Almighty.
