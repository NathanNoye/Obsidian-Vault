###### 1 
Now, brethren, we _wish to_ make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia, 

###### 2 
that in a great ordeal of affliction their abundance of joy and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality. 

###### 3 
For I testify that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, _they gave_ of their own accord, 

###### 4 
begging us with much urging for the favor of participation in the support of the saints, 

###### 5 
and _this_, not as we had expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. 

###### 6 
So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well. 

###### 7 
But just as you abound in everything, in faith and utterance and knowledge and in all earnestness and in the love we inspired in you, _see_ that you abound in this gracious work also. 

###### 8 
I am not speaking _this_ as a command, but as proving through the earnestness of others the sincerity of your love also. 

###### 9 
For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich. 

###### 10 
I give _my_ opinion in this matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do _this_, but also to desire _to do it_. 

###### 11 
But now finish doing it also, so that just as _there was_ the readiness to desire it, so _there may be_ also the completion of it by your ability. 

###### 12 
For if the readiness is present, it is acceptable according to what _a person_ has, not according to what he does not have. 

###### 13 
For _this_ is not for the ease of others _and_ for your affliction, but by way of equality-- 

###### 14 
at this present time your abundance _being a supply_ for their need, so that their abundance also may become _a supply_ for your need, that there may be equality; 

###### 15 
as it is written, "He who _gathered_ much did not have too much, and he who _gathered_ little had no lack." 

###### 16 
But thanks be to God who puts the same earnestness on your behalf in the heart of Titus. 

###### 17 
For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord. 

###### 18 
We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in _the things of_ the gospel _has spread_ through all the churches; 

###### 19 
and not only _this_, but he has also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for the glory of the Lord Himself, and _to show_ our readiness, 

###### 20 
taking precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift; 

###### 21 
for we have regard for what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men. 

###### 22 
We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often tested and found diligent in many things, but now even more diligent because of _his_ great confidence in you. 

###### 23 
As for Titus, _he is_ my partner and fellow worker among you; as for our brethren, _they are_ messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ. 

###### 24 
Therefore openly before the churches, show them the proof of your love and of our reason for boasting about you.
