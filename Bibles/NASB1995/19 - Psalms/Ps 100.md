###### 1 
Shout joyfully to the LORD, all the earth. 

###### 2 
Serve the LORD with gladness; Come before Him with joyful singing. 

###### 3 
Know that the LORD Himself is God; It is He who has made us, and not we ourselves; _We are_ His people and the sheep of His pasture. 

###### 4 
Enter His gates with thanksgiving _And_ His courts with praise. Give thanks to Him, bless His name. 

###### 5 
For the LORD is good; His lovingkindness is everlasting And His faithfulness to all generations.
