###### 1 
Why do you boast in evil, O mighty man? The lovingkindness of God _endures_ all day long. 

###### 2 
Your tongue devises destruction, Like a sharp razor, O worker of deceit. 

###### 3 
You love evil more than good, Falsehood more than speaking what is right. Selah. 

###### 4 
You love all words that devour, O deceitful tongue. 

###### 5 
But God will break you down forever; He will snatch you up and tear you away from _your_ tent, And uproot you from the land of the living. Selah. 

###### 6 
The righteous will see and fear, And will laugh at him, _saying_, 

###### 7 
"Behold, the man who would not make God his refuge, But trusted in the abundance of his riches _And_ was strong in his _evil_ desire." 

###### 8 
But as for me, I am like a green olive tree in the house of God; I trust in the lovingkindness of God forever and ever. 

###### 9 
I will give You thanks forever, because You have done _it_, And I will wait on Your name, for _it is_ good, in the presence of Your godly ones.
