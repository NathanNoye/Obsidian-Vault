###### 1 
Hear my voice, O God, in my complaint; Preserve my life from dread of the enemy. 

###### 2 
Hide me from the secret counsel of evildoers, From the tumult of those who do iniquity, 

###### 3 
Who have sharpened their tongue like a sword. They aimed bitter speech _as_ their arrow, 

###### 4 
To shoot from concealment at the blameless; Suddenly they shoot at him, and do not fear. 

###### 5 
They hold fast to themselves an evil purpose; They talk of laying snares secretly; They say, "Who can see them?" 

###### 6 
They devise injustices, _saying_, "We are ready with a well-conceived plot"; For the inward thought and the heart of a man are deep. 

###### 7 
But God will shoot at them with an arrow; Suddenly they will be wounded. 

###### 8 
So they will make him stumble; Their own tongue is against them; All who see them will shake the head. 

###### 9 
Then all men will fear, And they will declare the work of God, And will consider what He has done. 

###### 10 
The righteous man will be glad in the LORD and will take refuge in Him; And all the upright in heart will glory.
