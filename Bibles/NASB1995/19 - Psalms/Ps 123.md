###### 1 
To You I lift up my eyes, O You who are enthroned in the heavens! 

###### 2 
Behold, as the eyes of servants _look_ to the hand of their master, As the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes _look_ to the LORD our God, Until He is gracious to us. 

###### 3 
Be gracious to us, O LORD, be gracious to us, For we are greatly filled with contempt. 

###### 4 
Our soul is greatly filled With the scoffing of those who are at ease, _And_ with the contempt of the proud.
