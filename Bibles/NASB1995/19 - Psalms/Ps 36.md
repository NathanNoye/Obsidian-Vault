###### 1 
Transgression speaks to the ungodly within his heart; There is no fear of God before his eyes. 

###### 2 
For it flatters him in his _own_ eyes Concerning the discovery of his iniquity _and_ the hatred _of it_. 

###### 3 
The words of his mouth are wickedness and deceit; He has ceased to be wise _and_ to do good. 

###### 4 
He plans wickedness upon his bed; He sets himself on a path that is not good; He does not despise evil. 

###### 5 
Your lovingkindness, O LORD, extends to the heavens, Your faithfulness _reaches_ to the skies. 

###### 6 
Your righteousness is like the mountains of God; Your judgments are _like_ a great deep. O LORD, You preserve man and beast. 

###### 7 
How precious is Your lovingkindness, O God! And the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings. 

###### 8 
They drink their fill of the abundance of Your house; And You give them to drink of the river of Your delights. 

###### 9 
For with You is the fountain of life; In Your light we see light. 

###### 10 
O continue Your lovingkindness to those who know You, And Your righteousness to the upright in heart. 

###### 11 
Let not the foot of pride come upon me, And let not the hand of the wicked drive me away. 

###### 12 
There the doers of iniquity have fallen; They have been thrust down and cannot rise.
