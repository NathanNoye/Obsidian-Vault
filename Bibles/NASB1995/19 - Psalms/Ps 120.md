***


###### 1 
In my trouble I cried to the LORD, And He answered me. 

###### 2 
Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, From a deceitful tongue. 

###### 3 
What shall be given to you, and what more shall be done to you, You deceitful tongue? 

###### 4 
Sharp arrows of the warrior, With the _burning_ coals of the broom tree. 

###### 5 
Woe is me, for I sojourn in Meshech, For I dwell among the tents of Kedar! 

###### 6 
Too long has my soul had its dwelling With those who hate peace. 

###### 7 
I am _for_ peace, but when I speak, They are for war.
