###### 1 
Praise the LORD! How blessed is the man who fears the LORD, Who greatly delights in His commandments. 

###### 2 
His descendants will be mighty on earth; The generation of the upright will be blessed. 

###### 3 
Wealth and riches are in his house, And his righteousness endures forever. 

###### 4 
Light arises in the darkness for the upright; _He is_ gracious and compassionate and righteous. 

###### 5 
It is well with the man who is gracious and lends; He will maintain his cause in judgment. 

###### 6 
For he will never be shaken; The righteous will be remembered forever. 

###### 7 
He will not fear evil tidings; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the LORD. 

###### 8 
His heart is upheld, he will not fear, Until he looks _with satisfaction_ on his adversaries. 

###### 9 
He has given freely to the poor, His righteousness endures forever; His horn will be exalted in honor. 

###### 10 
The wicked will see it and be vexed, He will gnash his teeth and melt away; The desire of the wicked will perish.
