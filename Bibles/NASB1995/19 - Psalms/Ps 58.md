###### 1 
Do you indeed speak righteousness, O gods? Do you judge uprightly, O sons of men? 

###### 2 
No, in heart you work unrighteousness; On earth you weigh out the violence of your hands. 

###### 3 
The wicked are estranged from the womb; These who speak lies go astray from birth. 

###### 4 
They have venom like the venom of a serpent; Like a deaf cobra that stops up its ear, 

###### 5 
So that it does not hear the voice of charmers, _Or_ a skillful caster of spells. 

###### 6 
O God, shatter their teeth in their mouth; Break out the fangs of the young lions, O LORD. 

###### 7 
Let them flow away like water that runs off; _When_ he aims his arrows, let them be as headless shafts. 

###### 8 
_Let them be_ as a snail which melts away as it goes along, _Like_ the miscarriages of a woman which never see the sun. 

###### 9 
Before your pots can feel _the fire of_ thorns He will sweep them away with a whirlwind, the green and the burning alike. 

###### 10 
The righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance; He will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

###### 11 
And men will say, "Surely there is a reward for the righteous; Surely there is a God who judges on earth!"
