###### 1 
O God, _hasten_ to deliver me; O LORD, hasten to my help! 

###### 2 
Let those be ashamed and humiliated Who seek my life; Let those be turned back and dishonored Who delight in my hurt. 

###### 3 
Let those be turned back because of their shame Who say, "Aha, aha!" 

###### 4 
Let all who seek You rejoice and be glad in You; And let those who love Your salvation say continually, "Let God be magnified." 

###### 5 
But I am afflicted and needy; Hasten to me, O God! You are my help and my deliverer; O LORD, do not delay.
