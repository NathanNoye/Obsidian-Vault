###### 1 
God is known in Judah; His name is great in Israel. 

###### 2 
His tabernacle is in Salem; His dwelling place also is in Zion. 

###### 3 
There He broke the flaming arrows, The shield and the sword and the weapons of war. Selah. 

###### 4 
You are resplendent, More majestic than the mountains of prey. 

###### 5 
The stouthearted were plundered, They sank into sleep; And none of the warriors could use his hands. 

###### 6 
At Your rebuke, O God of Jacob, Both rider and horse were cast into a dead sleep. 

###### 7 
You, even You, are to be feared; And who may stand in Your presence when once You are angry? 

###### 8 
You caused judgment to be heard from heaven; The earth feared and was still 

###### 9 
When God arose to judgment, To save all the humble of the earth. Selah. 

###### 10 
For the wrath of man shall praise You; With a remnant of wrath You will gird Yourself. 

###### 11 
Make vows to the LORD your God and fulfill _them_; Let all who are around Him bring gifts to Him who is to be feared. 

###### 12 
He will cut off the spirit of princes; He is feared by the kings of the earth.
