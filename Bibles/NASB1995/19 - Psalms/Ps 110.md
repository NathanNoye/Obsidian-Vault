***


###### 1 
The LORD says to my Lord: "Sit at My right hand Until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet." 

###### 2 
The LORD will stretch forth Your strong scepter from Zion, _saying_, "Rule in the midst of Your enemies." 

###### 3 
Your people will volunteer freely in the day of Your power; In holy array, from the womb of the dawn, Your youth are to You _as_ the dew. 

###### 4 
The LORD has sworn and will not change His mind, "You are a priest forever According to the order of Melchizedek." 

###### 5 
The Lord is at Your right hand; He will shatter kings in the day of His wrath. 

###### 6 
He will judge among the nations, He will fill _them_ with corpses, He will shatter the chief men over a broad country. 

###### 7 
He will drink from the brook by the wayside; Therefore He will lift up _His_ head.
