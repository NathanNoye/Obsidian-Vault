###### 1 
His foundation is in the holy mountains. 

###### 2 
The LORD loves the gates of Zion More than all the _other_ dwelling places of Jacob. 

###### 3 
Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God. Selah. 

###### 4 
"I shall mention Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia: 'This one was born there.'" 

###### 5 
But of Zion it shall be said, "This one and that one were born in her"; And the Most High Himself will establish her. 

###### 6 
The LORD will count when He registers the peoples, "This one was born there." Selah. 

###### 7 
Then those who sing as well as those who play the flutes _shall say_, "All my springs _of joy_ are in you."
