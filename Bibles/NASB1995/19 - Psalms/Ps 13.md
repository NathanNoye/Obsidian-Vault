###### 1 
How long, O LORD? Will You forget me forever? How long will You hide Your face from me? 

###### 2 
How long shall I take counsel in my soul, _Having_ sorrow in my heart all the day? How long will my enemy be exalted over me? 

###### 3 
Consider _and_ answer me, O LORD my God; Enlighten my eyes, or I will sleep the _sleep of_ death, 

###### 4 
And my enemy will say, "I have overcome him," _And_ my adversaries will rejoice when I am shaken. 

###### 5 
But I have trusted in Your lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in Your salvation. 

###### 6 
I will sing to the LORD, Because He has dealt bountifully with me.
