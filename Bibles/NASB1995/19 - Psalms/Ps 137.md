***


###### 1 
By the rivers of Babylon, There we sat down and wept, When we remembered Zion. 

###### 2 
Upon the willows in the midst of it We hung our harps. 

###### 3 
For there our captors demanded of us songs, And our tormentors mirth, _saying_, "Sing us one of the songs of Zion." 

###### 4 
How can we sing the Lord's song In a foreign land? 

###### 5 
If I forget you, O Jerusalem, May my right hand forget _her skill_. 

###### 6 
May my tongue cling to the roof of my mouth If I do not remember you, If I do not exalt Jerusalem Above my chief joy. 

###### 7 
Remember, O LORD, against the sons of Edom The day of Jerusalem, Who said, "Raze it, raze it To its very foundation." 

###### 8 
O daughter of Babylon, you devastated one, How blessed will be the one who repays you With the recompense with which you have repaid us. 

###### 9 
How blessed will be the one who seizes and dashes your little ones Against the rock.
