###### 1 
Praise the LORD! Praise, O servants of the LORD, Praise the name of the LORD. 

###### 2 
Blessed be the name of the LORD From this time forth and forever. 

###### 3 
From the rising of the sun to its setting The name of the LORD is to be praised. 

###### 4 
The LORD is high above all nations; His glory is above the heavens. 

###### 5 
Who is like the LORD our God, Who is enthroned on high, 

###### 6 
Who humbles Himself to behold _The things that are_ in heaven and in the earth? 

###### 7 
He raises the poor from the dust And lifts the needy from the ash heap, 

###### 8 
To make _them_ sit with princes, With the princes of His people. 

###### 9 
He makes the barren woman abide in the house _As_ a joyful mother of children. Praise the LORD!
