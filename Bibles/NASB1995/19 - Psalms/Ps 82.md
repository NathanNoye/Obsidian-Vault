###### 1 
God takes His stand in His own congregation; He judges in the midst of the rulers. 

###### 2 
How long will you judge unjustly And show partiality to the wicked? Selah. 

###### 3 
Vindicate the weak and fatherless; Do justice to the afflicted and destitute. 

###### 4 
Rescue the weak and needy; Deliver _them_ out of the hand of the wicked. 

###### 5 
They do not know nor do they understand; They walk about in darkness; All the foundations of the earth are shaken. 

###### 6 
I said, "You are gods, And all of you are sons of the Most High. 

###### 7 
"Nevertheless you will die like men And fall like _any_ one of the princes." 

###### 8 
Arise, O God, judge the earth! For it is You who possesses all the nations.
