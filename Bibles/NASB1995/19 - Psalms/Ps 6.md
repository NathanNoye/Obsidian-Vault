###### 1 
O LORD, do not rebuke me in Your anger, Nor chasten me in Your wrath. 

###### 2 
Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I _am_ pining away; Heal me, O LORD, for my bones are dismayed. 

###### 3 
And my soul is greatly dismayed; But You, O LORD--how long? 

###### 4 
Return, O LORD, rescue my soul; Save me because of Your lovingkindness. 

###### 5 
For there is no mention of You in death; In Sheol who will give You thanks? 

###### 6 
I am weary with my sighing; Every night I make my bed swim, I dissolve my couch with my tears. 

###### 7 
My eye has wasted away with grief; It has become old because of all my adversaries. 

###### 8 
Depart from me, all you who do iniquity, For the LORD has heard the voice of my weeping. 

###### 9 
The LORD has heard my supplication, The LORD receives my prayer. 

###### 10 
All my enemies will be ashamed and greatly dismayed; They shall turn back, they will suddenly be ashamed.
