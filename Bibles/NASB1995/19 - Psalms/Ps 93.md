***


###### 1 
The LORD reigns, He is clothed with majesty; The LORD has clothed and girded Himself with strength; Indeed, the world is firmly established, it will not be moved. 

###### 2 
Your throne is established from of old; You are from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, O LORD, The floods have lifted up their voice, The floods lift up their pounding waves. 

###### 4 
More than the sounds of many waters, _Than_ the mighty breakers of the sea, The LORD on high is mighty. 

###### 5 
Your testimonies are fully confirmed; Holiness befits Your house, O LORD, forevermore.
