***


###### 1 
Unless the LORD builds the house, They labor in vain who build it; Unless the LORD guards the city, The watchman keeps awake in vain. 

###### 2 
It is vain for you to rise up early, To retire late, To eat the bread of painful labors; For He gives to His beloved _even in his_ sleep. 

###### 3 
Behold, children are a gift of the LORD, The fruit of the womb is a reward. 

###### 4 
Like arrows in the hand of a warrior, So are the children of one's youth. 

###### 5 
How blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them; They will not be ashamed When they speak with their enemies in the gate.
