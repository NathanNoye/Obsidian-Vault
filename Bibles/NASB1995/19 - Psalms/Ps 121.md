###### 1 
I will lift up my eyes to the mountains; From where shall my help come? 

###### 2 
My help _comes_ from the LORD, Who made heaven and earth. 

###### 3 
He will not allow your foot to slip; He who keeps you will not slumber. 

###### 4 
Behold, He who keeps Israel Will neither slumber nor sleep. 

###### 5 
The LORD is your keeper; The LORD is your shade on your right hand. 

###### 6 
The sun will not smite you by day, Nor the moon by night. 

###### 7 
The LORD will protect you from all evil; He will keep your soul. 

###### 8 
The LORD will guard your going out and your coming in From this time forth and forever.
