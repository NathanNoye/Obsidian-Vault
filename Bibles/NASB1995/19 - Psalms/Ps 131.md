***


###### 1 
O LORD, my heart is not proud, nor my eyes haughty; Nor do I involve myself in great matters, Or in things too difficult for me. 

###### 2 
Surely I have composed and quieted my soul; Like a weaned child _rests_ against his mother, My soul is like a weaned child within me. 

###### 3 
O Israel, hope in the LORD From this time forth and forever.
