###### 1 
We give thanks to You, O God, we give thanks, For Your name is near; Men declare Your wondrous works. 

###### 2 
"When I select an appointed time, It is I who judge with equity. 

###### 3 
"The earth and all who dwell in it melt; It is I who have firmly set its pillars. Selah. 

###### 4 
"I said to the boastful, 'Do not boast,' And to the wicked, 'Do not lift up the horn; 

###### 5 
Do not lift up your horn on high, Do not speak with insolent pride.'" 

###### 6 
For not from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the desert _comes_ exaltation; 

###### 7 
But God is the Judge; He puts down one and exalts another. 

###### 8 
For a cup is in the hand of the LORD, and the wine foams; It is well mixed, and He pours out of this; Surely all the wicked of the earth must drain _and_ drink down its dregs. 

###### 9 
But as for me, I will declare _it_ forever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob. 

###### 10 
And all the horns of the wicked He will cut off, _But_ the horns of the righteous will be lifted up.
