###### 1 
Save me, O God, by Your name, And vindicate me by Your power. 

###### 2 
Hear my prayer, O God; Give ear to the words of my mouth. 

###### 3 
For strangers have risen against me And violent men have sought my life; They have not set God before them. Selah. 

###### 4 
Behold, God is my helper; The Lord is the sustainer of my soul. 

###### 5 
He will recompense the evil to my foes; Destroy them in Your faithfulness. 

###### 6 
Willingly I will sacrifice to You; I will give thanks to Your name, O LORD, for it is good. 

###### 7 
For He has delivered me from all trouble, And my eye has looked _with satisfaction_ upon my enemies.
