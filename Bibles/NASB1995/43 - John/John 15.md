###### 1 
"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vinedresser. 

###### 2 
Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit, He takes away; and every _branch_ that bears fruit, He prunes it so that it may bear more fruit. 

###### 3 
You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. 

###### 4 
Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither _can_ you unless you abide in Me. 

###### 5 
I am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for apart from Me you can do nothing. 

###### 6 
If anyone does not abide in Me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up; and they gather them, and cast them into the fire and they are burned. 

###### 7 
If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. 

###### 8 
My Father is glorified by this, that you bear much fruit, and _so_ prove to be My disciples. 

###### 9 
Just as the Father has loved Me, I have also loved you; abide in My love. 

###### 10 
If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love; just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. 

###### 11 
These things I have spoken to you so that My joy may be in you, and _that_ your joy may be made full.Disciples' Relation to Each Other 

###### 12 
"This is My commandment, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. 

###### 13 
Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. 

###### 14 
You are My friends if you do what I command you. 

###### 15 
No longer do I call you slaves, for the slave does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I have heard from My Father I have made known to you. 

###### 16 
You did not choose Me but I chose you, and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit, and _that_ your fruit would remain, so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name He may give to you. 

###### 17 
This I command you, that you love one another.Disciples' Relation to the World 

###### 18 
"If the world hates you, you know that it has hated Me before _it hated_ you. 

###### 19 
If you were of the world, the world would love its own; but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this the world hates you. 

###### 20 
Remember the word that I said to you, 'A slave is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you; if they kept My word, they will keep yours also. 

###### 21 
But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know the One who sent Me. 

###### 22 
If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. 

###### 23 
He who hates Me hates My Father also. 

###### 24 
If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin; but now they have both seen and hated Me and My Father as well. 

###### 25 
But _they have done this_ to fulfill the word that is written in their Law, 'They hated Me without a cause.' 

###### 26 
"When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, _that is_ the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me, 

###### 27 
and you _will_ testify also, because you have been with Me from the beginning.
