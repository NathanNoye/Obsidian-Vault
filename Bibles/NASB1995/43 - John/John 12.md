###### 1 
Jesus, therefore, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 

###### 2 
So they made Him a supper there, and Martha was serving; but Lazarus was one of those reclining _at the table_ with Him. 

###### 3 
Mary then took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 

###### 4 
But Judas Iscariot, one of His disciples, who was intending to betray Him, *said, 

###### 5 
"Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor _people_?" 

###### 6 
Now he said this, not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it. 

###### 7 
Therefore Jesus said, **"Let her alone, so that she may keep it for the day of My burial.** 

###### 8 
For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have Me." 

###### 9 
The large crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead. 

###### 10 
But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death also; 

###### 11 
because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and were believing in Jesus.Jesus Enters Jerusalem 

###### 12 
On the next day the large crowd who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, 

###### 13 
took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and _began_ to shout, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel." 

###### 14 
Jesus, finding a young donkey, sat on it; as it is written, 

###### 15 
"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, seated on a donkey's colt." 

###### 16 
These things His disciples did not understand at the first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him. 

###### 17 
So the people, who were with Him when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead, continued to testify _about Him_. 

###### 18 
For this reason also the people went and met Him, because they heard that He had performed this sign. 

###### 19 
So the Pharisees said to one another, "You see that you are not doing any good; look, the world has gone after Him."Greeks Seek Jesus 

###### 20 
Now there were some Greeks among those who were going up to worship at the feast; 

###### 21 
these then came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and _began to_ ask him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus." 

###### 22 
Philip *came and *told Andrew; Andrew and Philip *came and *told Jesus. 

###### 23 
And Jesus *answered them, saying, **"The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.** 

###### 24 
Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. 

###### 25 
He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it to life eternal. 

###### 26 
If anyone serves Me, he must follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also; if anyone serves Me, the Father will honor him.Jesus Foretells His Death 

###### 27 
"Now My soul has become troubled; and what shall I say, 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour. 

###### 28 
Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came out of heaven: "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again." 

###### 29 
So the crowd _of people_ who stood by and heard it were saying that it had thundered; others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him." 

###### 30 
Jesus answered and said, **"This voice has not come for My sake, but for your sakes.** 

###### 31 
Now judgment is upon this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. 

###### 32 
And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself." 

###### 33 
But He was saying this to indicate the kind of death by which He was to die. 

###### 34 
The crowd then answered Him, "We have heard out of the Law that the Christ is to remain forever; and how can You say, **'The Son of Man must be lifted up'**? Who is this Son of Man?" 

###### 35 
So Jesus said to them, **"For a little while longer the Light is among you. Walk while you have the Light, so that darkness will not overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.** 

###### 36 
While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light." These things Jesus spoke, and He went away and hid Himself from them. 

###### 37 
But though He had performed so many signs before them, _yet_ they were not believing in Him. 

###### 38 
_This was_ to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet which he spoke: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" 

###### 39 
For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said again, 

###### 40 
"He has blinded their eyes and He hardened their heart, so that they would not see with their eyes and perceive with their heart, and be converted and I heal them." 

###### 41 
These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and he spoke of Him. 

###### 42 
Nevertheless many even of the rulers believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing _Him_, for fear that they would be put out of the synagogue; 

###### 43 
for they loved the approval of men rather than the approval of God. 

###### 44 
And Jesus cried out and said, **"He who believes in Me, does not believe in Me but in Him who sent Me.** 

###### 45 
He who sees Me sees the One who sent Me. 

###### 46 
I have come _as_ Light into the world, so that everyone who believes in Me will not remain in darkness. 

###### 47 
If anyone hears My sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world. 

###### 48 
He who rejects Me and does not receive My sayings, has one who judges him; the word I spoke is what will judge him at the last day. 

###### 49 
For I did not speak on My own initiative, but the Father Himself who sent Me has given Me a commandment _as to_ what to say and what to speak. 

###### 50 
I know that His commandment is eternal life; therefore the things I speak, I speak just as the Father has told Me."
