###### 1 
Hear this word which the LORD has spoken against you, sons of Israel, against the entire family which He brought up from the land of Egypt: 

###### 2 
"You only have I chosen among all the families of the earth; Therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities." 

###### 3 
Do two men walk together unless they have made an appointment? 

###### 4 
Does a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey? Does a young lion growl from his den unless he has captured _something_? 

###### 5 
Does a bird fall into a trap on the ground when there is no bait in it? Does a trap spring up from the earth when it captures nothing at all? 

###### 6 
If a trumpet is blown in a city will not the people tremble? If a calamity occurs in a city has not the LORD done it? 

###### 7 
Surely the Lord God does nothing Unless He reveals His secret counsel To His servants the prophets. 

###### 8 
A lion has roared! Who will not fear? The Lord God has spoken! Who can but prophesy? 

###### 9 
Proclaim on the citadels in Ashdod and on the citadels in the land of Egypt and say, "Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria and see _the_ great tumults within her and _the_ oppressions in her midst. 

###### 10 
But they do not know how to do what is right," declares the LORD, "these who hoard up violence and devastation in their citadels." 

###### 11 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God, "An enemy, even one surrounding the land, Will pull down your strength from you And your citadels will be looted." 

###### 12 
Thus says the LORD, "Just as the shepherd snatches from the lion's mouth a couple of legs or a piece of an ear, So will the sons of Israel dwelling in Samaria be snatched away-- With _the_ corner of a bed and _the_ cover of a couch! 

###### 13 
"Hear and testify against the house of Jacob," Declares the Lord God, the God of hosts. 

###### 14 
"For on the day that I punish Israel's transgressions, I will also punish the altars of Bethel; The horns of the altar will be cut off And they will fall to the ground. 

###### 15 
"I will also smite the winter house together with the summer house; The houses of ivory will also perish And the great houses will come to an end," Declares the LORD.
