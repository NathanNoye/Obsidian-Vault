###### 1 
"How beautiful you are, my darling, How beautiful you are! Your eyes are _like_ doves behind your veil; Your hair is like a flock of goats That have descended from Mount Gilead. 

###### 2 
"Your teeth are like a flock of _newly_ shorn ewes Which have come up from _their_ washing, All of which bear twins, And not one among them has lost her young. 

###### 3 
"Your lips are like a scarlet thread, And your mouth is lovely. Your temples are like a slice of a pomegranate Behind your veil. 

###### 4 
"Your neck is like the tower of David, Built with rows of stones On which are hung a thousand shields, All the round shields of the mighty men. 

###### 5 
"Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle Which feed among the lilies. 

###### 6 
"Until the cool of the day When the shadows flee away, I will go my way to the mountain of myrrh And to the hill of frankincense. 

###### 7 
"You are altogether beautiful, my darling, And there is no blemish in you. 

###### 8 
"_Come_ with me from Lebanon, _my_ bride, May you come with me from Lebanon. Journey down from the summit of Amana, From the summit of Senir and Hermon, From the dens of lions, From the mountains of leopards. 

###### 9 
"You have made my heart beat faster, my sister, _my_ bride; You have made my heart beat faster with a single _glance_ of your eyes, With a single strand of your necklace. 

###### 10 
"How beautiful is your love, my sister, _my_ bride! How much better is your love than wine, And the fragrance of your oils Than all _kinds_ of spices! 

###### 11 
"Your lips, _my_ bride, drip honey; Honey and milk are under your tongue, And the fragrance of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon. 

###### 12 
"A garden locked is my sister, _my_ bride, A rock garden locked, a spring sealed up. 

###### 13 
"Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates With choice fruits, henna with nard plants, 

###### 14 
Nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon, With all the trees of frankincense, Myrrh and aloes, along with all the finest spices. 

###### 15 
"_You are_ a garden spring, A well of fresh water, And streams _flowing_ from Lebanon." 

###### 16 
"Awake, O north _wind_, And come, _wind of_ the south; Make my garden breathe out _fragrance_, Let its spices be wafted abroad. May my beloved come into his garden And eat its choice fruits!"
