###### 1 
"I am the rose of Sharon, The lily of the valleys." 

###### 2 
"Like a lily among the thorns, So is my darling among the maidens." 

###### 3 
"Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, So is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I took great delight and sat down, And his fruit was sweet to my taste. 

###### 4 
"He has brought me to _his_ banquet hall, And his banner over me is love. 

###### 5 
"Sustain me with raisin cakes, Refresh me with apples, Because I am lovesick. 

###### 6 
"Let his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me." 

###### 7 
"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, By the gazelles or by the hinds of the field, That you do not arouse or awaken _my_ love Until she pleases." 

###### 8 
"Listen! My beloved! Behold, he is coming, Climbing on the mountains, Leaping on the hills! 

###### 9 
"My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Behold, he is standing behind our wall, He is looking through the windows, He is peering through the lattice. 

###### 10 
"My beloved responded and said to me, 'Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along. 

###### 11 
'For behold, the winter is past, The rain is over _and_ gone. 

###### 12 
'The flowers have _already_ appeared in the land; The time has arrived for pruning _the vines_, And the voice of the turtledove has been heard in our land. 

###### 13 
'The fig tree has ripened its figs, And the vines in blossom have given forth _their_ fragrance. Arise, my darling, my beautiful one, And come along!'" 

###### 14 
"O my dove, in the clefts of the rock, In the secret place of the steep pathway, Let me see your form, Let me hear your voice; For your voice is sweet, And your form is lovely." 

###### 15 
"Catch the foxes for us, The little foxes that are ruining the vineyards, While our vineyards are in blossom." 

###### 16 
"My beloved is mine, and I am his; He pastures _his flock_ among the lilies. 

###### 17 
"Until the cool of the day when the shadows flee away, Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle Or a young stag on the mountains of Bether."
