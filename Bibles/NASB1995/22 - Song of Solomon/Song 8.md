###### 1 
"Oh that you were like a brother to me Who nursed at my mother's breasts. _If_ I found you outdoors, I would kiss you; No one would despise me, either. 

###### 2 
"I would lead you _and_ bring you Into the house of my mother, who used to instruct me; I would give you spiced wine to drink from the juice of my pomegranates. 

###### 3 
"Let his left hand be under my head And his right hand embrace me." 

###### 4 
"I want you to swear, O daughters of Jerusalem, Do not arouse or awaken _my_ love Until she pleases." 

###### 5 
"Who is this coming up from the wilderness Leaning on her beloved?" "Beneath the apple tree I awakened you; There your mother was in labor with you, There she was in labor _and_ gave you birth. 

###### 6 
"Put me like a seal over your heart, Like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, Jealousy is as severe as Sheol; Its flashes are flashes of fire, The _very_ flame of the LORD. 

###### 7 
"Many waters cannot quench love, Nor will rivers overflow it; If a man were to give all the riches of his house for love, It would be utterly despised." 

###### 8 
"We have a little sister, And she has no breasts; What shall we do for our sister On the day when she is spoken for? 

###### 9 
"If she is a wall, We will build on her a battlement of silver; But if she is a door, We will barricade her with planks of cedar." 

###### 10 
"I was a wall, and my breasts were like towers; Then I became in his eyes as one who finds peace. 

###### 11 
"Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers. Each one was to bring a thousand _shekels_ of silver for its fruit. 

###### 12 
"My very own vineyard is at my disposal; The thousand _shekels_ are for you, Solomon, And two hundred are for those who take care of its fruit." 

###### 13 
"O you who sit in the gardens, _My_ companions are listening for your voice-- Let me hear it!" 

###### 14 
"Hurry, my beloved, And be like a gazelle or a young stag On the mountains of spices."
