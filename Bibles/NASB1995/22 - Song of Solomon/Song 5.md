###### 1 
"I have come into my garden, my sister, _my_ bride; I have gathered my myrrh along with my balsam. I have eaten my honeycomb and my honey; I have drunk my wine and my milk. Eat, friends; Drink and imbibe deeply, O lovers." 

###### 2 
"I was asleep but my heart was awake. A voice! My beloved was knocking: 'Open to me, my sister, my darling, My dove, my perfect one! For my head is drenched with dew, My locks with the damp of the night.' 

###### 3 
"I have taken off my dress, How can I put it on _again_? I have washed my feet, How can I dirty them _again_? 

###### 4 
"My beloved extended his hand through the opening, And my feelings were aroused for him. 

###### 5 
"I arose to open to my beloved; And my hands dripped with myrrh, And my fingers with liquid myrrh, On the handles of the bolt. 

###### 6 
"I opened to my beloved, But my beloved had turned away _and_ had gone! My heart went out _to him_ as he spoke. I searched for him but I did not find him; I called him but he did not answer me. 

###### 7 
"The watchmen who make the rounds in the city found me, They struck me _and_ wounded me; The guardsmen of the walls took away my shawl from me. 

###### 8 
"I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, If you find my beloved, As to what you will tell him: For I am lovesick." 

###### 9 
"What kind of beloved is your beloved, O most beautiful among women? What kind of beloved is your beloved, That thus you adjure us?"Admiration by the Bride 

###### 10 
"My beloved is dazzling and ruddy, Outstanding among ten thousand. 

###### 11 
"His head is _like_ gold, pure gold; His locks are _like_ clusters of dates _And_ black as a raven. 

###### 12 
"His eyes are like doves Beside streams of water, Bathed in milk, _And_ reposed in _their_ setting. 

###### 13 
"His cheeks are like a bed of balsam, Banks of sweet-scented herbs; His lips are lilies Dripping with liquid myrrh. 

###### 14 
"His hands are rods of gold Set with beryl; His abdomen is carved ivory Inlaid with sapphires. 

###### 15 
"His legs are pillars of alabaster Set on pedestals of pure gold; His appearance is like Lebanon Choice as the cedars. 

###### 16 
"His mouth is _full of_ sweetness. And he is wholly desirable. This is my beloved and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem."
