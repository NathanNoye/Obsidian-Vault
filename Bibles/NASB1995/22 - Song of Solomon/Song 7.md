###### 1 
"How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O prince's daughter! The curves of your hips are like jewels, The work of the hands of an artist. 

###### 2 
"Your navel is _like_ a round goblet Which never lacks mixed wine; Your belly is like a heap of wheat Fenced about with lilies. 

###### 3 
"Your two breasts are like two fawns, Twins of a gazelle. 

###### 4 
"Your neck is like a tower of ivory, Your eyes _like_ the pools in Heshbon By the gate of Bath-rabbim; Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, Which faces toward Damascus. 

###### 5 
"Your head crowns you like Carmel, And the flowing locks of your head are like purple threads; _The_ king is captivated by _your_ tresses. 

###### 6 
"How beautiful and how delightful you are, _My_ love, with _all_ your charms! 

###### 7 
"Your stature is like a palm tree, And your breasts are _like its_ clusters. 

###### 8 
"I said, 'I will climb the palm tree, I will take hold of its fruit stalks.' Oh, may your breasts be like clusters of the vine, And the fragrance of your breath like apples, 

###### 9 
And your mouth like the best wine!" "It goes _down_ smoothly for my beloved, Flowing gently _through_ the lips of those who fall asleep.The Union of Love 

###### 10 
"I am my beloved's, And his desire is for me. 

###### 11 
"Come, my beloved, let us go out into the country, Let us spend the night in the villages. 

###### 12 
"Let us rise early _and go_ to the vineyards; Let us see whether the vine has budded _And its_ blossoms have opened, _And whether_ the pomegranates have bloomed. There I will give you my love. 

###### 13 
"The mandrakes have given forth fragrance; And over our doors are all choice _fruits_, Both new and old, Which I have saved up for you, my beloved.
