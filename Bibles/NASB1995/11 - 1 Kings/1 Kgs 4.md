Now King Solomon was king over all Israel. 

###### 2

###### 3 
Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha _were_ secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud _was_ the recorder; 

###### 4 
and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada _was_ over the army; and Zadok and Abiathar _were_ priests; 

###### 5 
and Azariah the son of Nathan _was_ over the deputies; and Zabud the son of Nathan, a priest, _was_ the king's friend; 

###### 6 
and Ahishar was over the household; and Adoniram the son of Abda _was_ over the men subject to forced labor. 

###### 7 
Solomon had twelve deputies over all Israel, who provided for the king and his household; each man had to provide for a month in the year. 

###### 8 
These are their names: Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; 

###### 9 
Ben-deker in Makaz and Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan; 

###### 10 
Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (Socoh _was_ his and all the land of Hepher); 

###### 11 
Ben-abinadab, _in_ all the height of Dor (Taphath the daughter of Solomon was his wife); 

###### 12 
Baana the son of Ahilud, _in_ Taanach and Megiddo, and all Beth-shean which is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as the other side of Jokmeam; 

###### 13 
Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (the towns of Jair, the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead were his: the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars _were_ his); 

###### 14 
Ahinadab the son of Iddo, _in_ Mahanaim; 

###### 15

###### 18 
Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; 

###### 19 
Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan; and _he was_ the only deputy who _was_ in the land.Solomon's Power, Wealth and Wisdom 

###### 20 
Judah and Israel _were_ as numerous as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance; _they_ were eating and drinking and rejoicing. 

###### 21 
Now Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the River _to_ the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; _they_ brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. 

###### 22 
Solomon's provision for one day was thirty kors of fine flour and sixty kors of meal, 

###### 23 
ten fat oxen, twenty pasture-fed oxen, a hundred sheep besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. 

###### 24 
For he had dominion over everything west of the River, from Tiphsah even to Gaza, over all the kings west of the River; and he had peace on all sides around about him. 

###### 25 
So Judah and Israel lived in safety, every man under his vine and his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days of Solomon. 

###### 26 
Solomon had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen. 

###### 27 
Those deputies provided for King Solomon and all who came to King Solomon's table, each in his month; they left nothing lacking. 

###### 28 
They also brought barley and straw for the horses and swift steeds to the place where it should be, each according to his charge. 

###### 29 
Now God gave Solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind, like the sand that is on the seashore. 

###### 30 
Solomon's wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. 

###### 31 
For he was wiser than all men, than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, Calcol and Darda, the sons of Mahol; and his fame was _known_ in all the surrounding nations. 

###### 32 
He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. 

###### 33 
He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall; he spoke also of animals and birds and creeping things and fish. 

###### 34 
Men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom.
