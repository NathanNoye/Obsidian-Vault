###### 1 
Now Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished all his house. 

###### 2 
He built the house of the forest of Lebanon; its length was 100 cubits and its width 50 cubits and its height 30 cubits, on four rows of cedar pillars with cedar beams on the pillars. 

###### 3 
It was paneled with cedar above the side chambers which were on the 45 pillars, 15 in each row. 

###### 4 
_There were artistic window_ frames in three rows, and window was opposite window in three ranks. 

###### 5 
All the doorways and doorposts _had_ squared _artistic_ frames, and window was opposite window in three ranks. 

###### 6 
Then he made the hall of pillars; its length was 50 cubits and its width 30 cubits, and a porch _was_ in front of them and pillars and a threshold in front of them. 

###### 7 
He made the hall of the throne where he was to judge, the hall of judgment, and it was paneled with cedar from floor to floor. 

###### 8 
His house where he was to live, the other court inward from the hall, was of the same workmanship. He also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had married. 

###### 9 
All these were of costly stones, of stone cut according to measure, sawed with saws, inside and outside; even from the foundation to the coping, and so on the outside to the great court. 

###### 10 
The foundation was of costly stones, _even_ large stones, stones of ten cubits and stones of eight cubits. 

###### 11 
And above were costly stones, stone cut according to measure, and cedar. 

###### 12 
So the great court all around _had_ three rows of cut stone and a row of cedar beams even as the inner court of the house of the LORD, and the porch of the house.Hiram's Work in the Temple 

###### 13 
Now King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. 

###### 14 
He was a widow's son from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was filled with wisdom and understanding and skill for doing any work in bronze. So he came to King Solomon and performed all his work. 

###### 15 
He fashioned the two pillars of bronze; eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured the circumference of both. 

###### 16 
He also made two capitals of molten bronze to set on the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits and the height of the other capital was five cubits. 

###### 17 
_There were_ nets of network and twisted threads of chainwork for the capitals which were on the top of the pillars; seven for the one capital and seven for the other capital. 

###### 18 
So he made the pillars, and two rows around on the one network to cover the capitals which were on the top of the pomegranates; and so he did for the other capital. 

###### 19 
The capitals which _were_ on the top of the pillars in the porch were of lily design, four cubits. 

###### 20 
_There were_ capitals on the two pillars, even above _and_ close to the rounded projection which was beside the network; and the pomegranates _numbered_ two hundred in rows around both capitals. 

###### 21 
Thus he set up the pillars at the porch of the nave; and he set up the right pillar and named it Jachin, and he set up the left pillar and named it Boaz. 

###### 22 
On the top of the pillars was lily design. So the work of the pillars was finished. 

###### 23 
Now he made the sea of cast _metal_ ten cubits from brim to brim, circular in form, and its height was five cubits, and thirty cubits in circumference. 

###### 24 
Under its brim gourds went around encircling it ten to a cubit, completely surrounding the sea; the gourds were in two rows, cast with the rest. 

###### 25 
It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; and the sea _was set_ on top of them, and all their rear parts _turned_ inward. 

###### 26 
It was a handbreadth thick, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, _as_ a lily blossom; it could hold two thousand baths. 

###### 27 
Then he made the ten stands of bronze; the length of each stand was four cubits and its width four cubits and its height three cubits. 

###### 28 
This was the design of the stands: they had borders, even borders between the frames, 

###### 29 
and on the borders which were between the frames _were_ lions, oxen and cherubim; and on the frames there _was_ a pedestal above, and beneath the lions and oxen _were_ wreaths of hanging work. 

###### 30 
Now each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles, and its four feet had supports; beneath the basin _were_ cast supports with wreaths at each side. 

###### 31 
Its opening inside the crown at the top _was_ a cubit, and its opening _was_ round like the design of a pedestal, a cubit and a half; and also on its opening _there were_ engravings, and their borders were square, not round. 

###### 32 
The four wheels _were_ underneath the borders, and the axles of the wheels _were_ on the stand. And the height of a wheel _was_ a cubit and a half. 

###### 33 
The workmanship of the wheels _was_ like the workmanship of a chariot wheel. Their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs _were_ all cast. 

###### 34 
Now _there were_ four supports at the four corners of each stand; its supports _were_ part of the stand itself. 

###### 35 
On the top of the stand _there was_ a circular form half a cubit high, and on the top of the stand its stays and its borders _were_ part of it. 

###### 36 
He engraved on the plates of its stays and on its borders, cherubim, lions and palm trees, according to the clear space on each, with wreaths _all_ around. 

###### 37 
He made the ten stands like this: all of them had one casting, one measure and one form. 

###### 38 
He made ten basins of bronze, one basin held forty baths; each basin _was_ four cubits, _and_ on each of the ten stands _was_ one basin. 

###### 39 
Then he set the stands, five on the right side of the house and five on the left side of the house; and he set the sea _of cast metal_ on the right side of the house eastward toward the south. 

###### 40 
Now Hiram made the basins and the shovels and the bowls. So Hiram finished doing all the work which he performed for King Solomon _in_ the house of the LORD: 

###### 41 
the two pillars and the _two_ bowls of the capitals which _were_ on the top of the two pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals which _were_ on the top of the pillars; 

###### 42 
and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network to cover the two bowls of the capitals which _were_ on the tops of the pillars; 

###### 43 
and the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands; 

###### 44 
and the one sea and the twelve oxen under the sea; 

###### 45 
and the pails and the shovels and the bowls; even all these utensils which Hiram made for King Solomon _in_ the house of the LORD _were_ of polished bronze. 

###### 46 
In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. 

###### 47 
Solomon left all the utensils _unweighed_, because _they were_ too many; the weight of the bronze could not be ascertained. 

###### 48 
Solomon made all the furniture which _was in_ the house of the LORD: the golden altar and the golden table on which _was_ the bread of the Presence; 

###### 49 
and the lampstands, five on the right side and five on the left, in front of the inner sanctuary, of pure gold; and the flowers and the lamps and the tongs, of gold; 

###### 50 
and the cups and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the firepans, of pure gold; and the hinges both for the doors of the inner house, the most holy place, _and_ for the doors of the house, _that is_, of the nave, of gold. 

###### 51 
Thus all the work that King Solomon performed _in_ the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things dedicated by his father David, the silver and the gold and the utensils, _and_ he put them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.
