###### 1 
Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity Than he who is perverse in speech and is a fool. 

###### 2 
Also it is not good for a person to be without knowledge, And he who hurries his footsteps errs. 

###### 3 
The foolishness of man ruins his way, And his heart rages against the LORD. 

###### 4 
Wealth adds many friends, But a poor man is separated from his friend. 

###### 5 
A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who tells lies will not escape. 

###### 6 
Many will seek the favor of a generous man, And every man is a friend to him who gives gifts. 

###### 7 
All the brothers of a poor man hate him; How much more do his friends abandon him! He pursues _them with_ words, _but_ they are gone. 

###### 8 
He who gets wisdom loves his own soul; He who keeps understanding will find good. 

###### 9 
A false witness will not go unpunished, And he who tells lies will perish. 

###### 10 
Luxury is not fitting for a fool; Much less for a slave to rule over princes. 

###### 11 
A man's discretion makes him slow to anger, And it is his glory to overlook a transgression. 

###### 12 
The king's wrath is like the roaring of a lion, But his favor is like dew on the grass. 

###### 13 
A foolish son is destruction to his father, And the contentions of a wife are a constant dripping. 

###### 14 
House and wealth are an inheritance from fathers, But a prudent wife is from the LORD. 

###### 15 
Laziness casts into a deep sleep, And an idle man will suffer hunger. 

###### 16 
He who keeps the commandment keeps his soul, _But_ he who is careless of conduct will die. 

###### 17 
One who is gracious to a poor man lends to the LORD, And He will repay him for his good deed. 

###### 18 
Discipline your son while there is hope, And do not desire his death. 

###### 19 
_A man of_ great anger will bear the penalty, For if you rescue _him_, you will only have to do it again. 

###### 20 
Listen to counsel and accept discipline, That you may be wise the rest of your days. 

###### 21 
Many plans are in a man's heart, But the counsel of the LORD will stand. 

###### 22 
What is desirable in a man is his kindness, And _it is_ better to be a poor man than a liar. 

###### 23 
The fear of the LORD _leads_ to life, So that one may sleep satisfied, untouched by evil. 

###### 24 
The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, _But_ will not even bring it back to his mouth. 

###### 25 
Strike a scoffer and the naive may become shrewd, But reprove one who has understanding and he will gain knowledge. 

###### 26 
He who assaults _his_ father _and_ drives _his_ mother away Is a shameful and disgraceful son. 

###### 27 
Cease listening, my son, to discipline, _And you will_ stray from the words of knowledge. 

###### 28 
A rascally witness makes a mockery of justice, And the mouth of the wicked spreads iniquity. 

###### 29 
Judgments are prepared for scoffers, And blows for the back of fools.
