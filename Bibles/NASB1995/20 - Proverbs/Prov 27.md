###### 1 
Do not boast about tomorrow, For you do not know what a day may bring forth. 

###### 2 
Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; A stranger, and not your own lips. 

###### 3 
A stone is heavy and the sand weighty, But the provocation of a fool is heavier than both of them. 

###### 4 
Wrath is fierce and anger is a flood, But who can stand before jealousy? 

###### 5 
Better is open rebuke Than love that is concealed. 

###### 6 
Faithful are the wounds of a friend, But deceitful are the kisses of an enemy. 

###### 7 
A sated man loathes honey, But to a famished man any bitter thing is sweet. 

###### 8 
Like a bird that wanders from her nest, So is a man who wanders from his home. 

###### 9 
Oil and perfume make the heart glad, So a man's counsel is sweet to his friend. 

###### 10 
Do not forsake your own friend or your father's friend, And do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity; Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother far away. 

###### 11 
Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, That I may reply to him who reproaches me. 

###### 12 
A prudent man sees evil _and_ hides himself, The naive proceed _and_ pay the penalty. 

###### 13 
Take his garment when he becomes surety for a stranger; And for an adulterous woman hold him in pledge. 

###### 14 
He who blesses his friend with a loud voice early in the morning, It will be reckoned a curse to him. 

###### 15 
A constant dripping on a day of steady rain And a contentious woman are alike; 

###### 16 
He who would restrain her restrains the wind, And grasps oil with his right hand. 

###### 17 
Iron sharpens iron, So one man sharpens another. 

###### 18 
He who tends the fig tree will eat its fruit, And he who cares for his master will be honored. 

###### 19 
As in water face _reflects_ face, So the heart of man _reflects_ man. 

###### 20 
Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, Nor are the eyes of man ever satisfied. 

###### 21 
The crucible is for silver and the furnace for gold, And each _is tested_ by the praise accorded him. 

###### 22 
Though you pound a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, _Yet_ his foolishness will not depart from him. 

###### 23 
Know well the condition of your flocks, _And_ pay attention to your herds; 

###### 24 
For riches are not forever, Nor does a crown _endure_ to all generations. 

###### 25 
_When_ the grass disappears, the new growth is seen, And the herbs of the mountains are gathered in, 

###### 26 
The lambs _will be_ for your clothing, And the goats _will bring_ the price of a field, 

###### 27 
And _there will be_ goats' milk enough for your food, For the food of your household, And sustenance for your maidens.
