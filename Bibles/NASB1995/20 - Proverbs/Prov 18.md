***


###### 1 
He who separates himself seeks _his own_ desire, He quarrels against all sound wisdom. 

###### 2 
A fool does not delight in understanding, But only in revealing his own mind. 

###### 3 
When a wicked man comes, contempt also comes, And with dishonor _comes_ scorn. 

###### 4 
The words of a man's mouth are deep waters; The fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook. 

###### 5 
To show partiality to the wicked is not good, _Nor_ to thrust aside the righteous in judgment. 

###### 6 
A fool's lips bring strife, And his mouth calls for blows. 

###### 7 
A fool's mouth is his ruin, And his lips are the snare of his soul. 

###### 8 
The words of a whisperer are like dainty morsels, And they go down into the innermost parts of the body. 

###### 9 
He also who is slack in his work Is brother to him who destroys. 

###### 10 
The name of the LORD is a strong tower; The righteous runs into it and is safe. 

###### 11 
A rich man's wealth is his strong city, And like a high wall in his own imagination. 

###### 12 
Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, But humility _goes_ before honor. 

###### 13 
He who gives an answer before he hears, It is folly and shame to him. 

###### 14 
The spirit of a man can endure his sickness, But _as for_ a broken spirit who can bear it? 

###### 15 
The mind of the prudent acquires knowledge, And the ear of the wise seeks knowledge. 

###### 16 
A man's gift makes room for him And brings him before great men. 

###### 17 
The first to plead his case _seems_ right, _Until_ another comes and examines him. 

###### 18 
The _cast_ lot puts an end to strife And decides between the mighty ones. 

###### 19 
A brother offended _is harder to be won_ than a strong city, And contentions are like the bars of a citadel. 

###### 20 
With the fruit of a man's mouth his stomach will be satisfied; He will be satisfied _with_ the product of his lips. 

###### 21 
Death and life are in the power of the tongue, And those who love it will eat its fruit. 

###### 22 
He who finds a wife finds a good thing And obtains favor from the LORD. 

###### 23 
The poor man utters supplications, But the rich man answers roughly. 

###### 24 
A man of _too many_ friends _comes_ to ruin, But there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother.
