###### 1 
My son, keep my words And treasure my commandments within you. 

###### 2 
Keep my commandments and live, And my teaching as the apple of your eye. 

###### 3 
Bind them on your fingers; Write them on the tablet of your heart. 

###### 4 
Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," And call understanding _your_ intimate friend; 

###### 5 
That they may keep you from an adulteress, From the foreigner who flatters with her words. 

###### 6 
For at the window of my house I looked out through my lattice, 

###### 7 
And I saw among the naive, _And_ discerned among the youths A young man lacking sense, 

###### 8 
Passing through the street near her corner; And he takes the way to her house, 

###### 9 
In the twilight, in the evening, In the middle of the night and _in_ the darkness. 

###### 10 
And behold, a woman _comes_ to meet him, Dressed as a harlot and cunning of heart. 

###### 11 
She is boisterous and rebellious, Her feet do not remain at home; 

###### 12 
_She is_ now in the streets, now in the squares, And lurks by every corner. 

###### 13 
So she seizes him and kisses him And with a brazen face she says to him: 

###### 14 
"I was due to offer peace offerings; Today I have paid my vows. 

###### 15 
"Therefore I have come out to meet you, To seek your presence earnestly, and I have found you. 

###### 16 
"I have spread my couch with coverings, With colored linens of Egypt. 

###### 17 
"I have sprinkled my bed With myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. 

###### 18 
"Come, let us drink our fill of love until morning; Let us delight ourselves with caresses. 

###### 19 
"For my husband is not at home, He has gone on a long journey; 

###### 20 
He has taken a bag of money with him, At the full moon he will come home." 

###### 21 
With her many persuasions she entices him; With her flattering lips she seduces him. 

###### 22 
Suddenly he follows her As an ox goes to the slaughter, Or as _one in_ fetters to the discipline of a fool, 

###### 23 
Until an arrow pierces through his liver; As a bird hastens to the snare, So he does not know that it _will cost him_ his life. 

###### 24 
Now therefore, _my_ sons, listen to me, And pay attention to the words of my mouth. 

###### 25 
Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths. 

###### 26 
For many are the victims she has cast down, And numerous are all her slain. 

###### 27 
Her house is the way to Sheol, Descending to the chambers of death.
