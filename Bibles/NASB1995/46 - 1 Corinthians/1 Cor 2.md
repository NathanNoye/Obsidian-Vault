###### 1 
And when I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God. 

###### 2 
For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and Him crucified. 

###### 3 
I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling, 

###### 4 
and my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, 

###### 5 
so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God. 

###### 6 
Yet we do speak wisdom among those who are mature; a wisdom, however, not of this age nor of the rulers of this age, who are passing away; 

###### 7 
but we speak God's wisdom in a mystery, the hidden _wisdom_ which God predestined before the ages to our glory; 

###### 8 
_the wisdom_ which none of the rulers of this age has understood; for if they had understood it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory; 

###### 9 
but just as it is written, "Things which eye has not seen and ear has not heard, And _which_ have not entered the heart of man, All that God has prepared for those who love Him." 

###### 10 
For to us God revealed _them_ through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God. 

###### 11 
For who among men knows the _thoughts_ of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so the _thoughts_ of God no one knows except the Spirit of God. 

###### 12 
Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God, 

###### 13 
which things we also speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit, combining spiritual _thoughts_ with spiritual _words_. 

###### 14 
But a natural man does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually appraised. 

###### 15 
But he who is spiritual appraises all things, yet he himself is appraised by no one. 

###### 16 
For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ.
