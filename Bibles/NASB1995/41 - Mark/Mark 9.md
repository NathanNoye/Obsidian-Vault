###### 1 
And Jesus was saying to them, **"Truly I say to you, there are some of those who are standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power."** 

###### 2 
Six days later, Jesus *took with Him Peter and James and John, and *brought them up on a high mountain by themselves. And He was transfigured before them; 

###### 3 
and His garments became radiant and exceedingly white, as no launderer on earth can whiten them. 

###### 4 
Elijah appeared to them along with Moses; and they were talking with Jesus. 

###### 5 
Peter *said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three tabernacles, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah." 

###### 6 
For he did not know what to answer; for they became terrified. 

###### 7 
Then a cloud formed, overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is My beloved Son, listen to Him!" 

###### 8 
All at once they looked around and saw no one with them anymore, except Jesus alone. 

###### 9 
As they were coming down from the mountain, He gave them orders not to relate to anyone what they had seen, until the Son of Man rose from the dead. 

###### 10 
They seized upon that statement, discussing with one another what rising from the dead meant. 

###### 11 
They asked Him, saying, "_Why is it_ that the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 

###### 12 
And He said to them, **"Elijah does first come and restore all things. And _yet_ how is it written of the Son of Man that He will suffer many things and be treated with contempt?** 

###### 13 
But I say to you that Elijah has indeed come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written of him."All Things Possible 

###### 14 
When they came _back_ to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them, and _some_ scribes arguing with them. 

###### 15 
Immediately, when the entire crowd saw Him, they were amazed and _began_ running up to greet Him. 

###### 16 
And He asked them, **"What are you discussing with them?"** 

###### 17 
And one of the crowd answered Him, "Teacher, I brought You my son, possessed with a spirit which makes him mute; 

###### 18 
and whenever it seizes him, it slams him _to the ground_ and he foams _at the mouth_, and grinds his teeth and stiffens out. I told Your disciples to cast it out, and they could not _do it_." 

###### 19 
And He *answered them and *said, **"O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I put up with you? Bring him to Me!"** 

###### 20 
They brought the boy to Him. When he saw Him, immediately the spirit threw him into a convulsion, and falling to the ground, he _began_ rolling around and foaming _at the mouth_. 

###### 21 
And He asked his father, **"How long has this been happening to him?"** And he said, "From childhood. 

###### 22 
It has often thrown him both into the fire and into the water to destroy him. But if You can do anything, take pity on us and help us!" 

###### 23 
And Jesus said to him, **"'If You can?' All things are possible to him who believes."** 

###### 24 
Immediately the boy's father cried out and said, "I do believe; help my unbelief." 

###### 25 
When Jesus saw that a crowd was rapidly gathering, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, **"You deaf and mute spirit, I command you, come out of him and do not enter him again."** 

###### 26 
After crying out and throwing him into terrible convulsions, it came out; and _the boy_ became so much like a corpse that most _of them_ said, "He is dead!" 

###### 27 
But Jesus took him by the hand and raised him; and he got up. 

###### 28 
When He came into _the_ house, His disciples _began_ questioning Him privately, "Why could we not drive it out?" 

###### 29 
And He said to them, **"This kind cannot come out by anything but prayer."**Death and Resurrection Foretold 

###### 30 
From there they went out and _began_ to go through Galilee, and He did not want anyone to know _about it_. 

###### 31 
For He was teaching His disciples and telling them, **"The Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill Him; and when He has been killed, He will rise three days later."** 

###### 32 
But they did not understand _this_ statement, and they were afraid to ask Him. 

###### 33 
They came to Capernaum; and when He was in the house, He _began_ to question them, **"What were you discussing on the way?"** 

###### 34 
But they kept silent, for on the way they had discussed with one another which _of them was_ the greatest. 

###### 35 
Sitting down, He called the twelve and *said to them, **"If anyone wants to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all."** 

###### 36 
Taking a child, He set him before them, and taking him in His arms, He said to them, 

###### 37 
"Whoever receives one child like this in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me does not receive Me, but Him who sent Me."Dire Warnings 

###### 38 
John said to Him, "Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we tried to prevent him because he was not following us." 

###### 39 
But Jesus said, **"Do not hinder him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name, and be able soon afterward to speak evil of Me.** 

###### 40 
For he who is not against us is for us. 

###### 41 
For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because of your name as _followers_ of Christ, truly I say to you, he will not lose his reward. 

###### 42 
"Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe to stumble, it would be better for him if, with a heavy millstone hung around his neck, he had been cast into the sea. 

###### 43 
If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life crippled, than, having your two hands, to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire, 

###### 44 
[**where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched**.] 

###### 45 
If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off; it is better for you to enter life lame, than, having your two feet, to be cast into hell, 

###### 46 
[**where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched**.] 

###### 47 
If your eye causes you to stumble, throw it out; it is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell, 

###### 48 
where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched. 

###### 49 
"For everyone will be salted with fire. 

###### 50 
Salt is good; but if the salt becomes unsalty, with what will you make it salty _again_? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another."
