###### 1 
The oracle concerning Moab. Surely in a night Ar of Moab is devastated _and_ ruined; Surely in a night Kir of Moab is devastated _and_ ruined. 

###### 2 
They have gone up to the temple and _to_ Dibon, _even_ to the high places to weep. Moab wails over Nebo and Medeba; Everyone's head is bald _and_ every beard is cut off. 

###### 3 
In their streets they have girded themselves with sackcloth; On their housetops and in their squares Everyone is wailing, dissolved in tears. 

###### 4 
Heshbon and Elealeh also cry out, Their voice is heard all the way to Jahaz; Therefore the armed men of Moab cry aloud; His soul trembles within him. 

###### 5 
My heart cries out for Moab; His fugitives are as far as Zoar _and_ Eglath-shelishiyah, For they go up the ascent of Luhith weeping; Surely on the road to Horonaim they raise a cry of distress over _their_ ruin. 

###### 6 
For the waters of Nimrim are desolate. Surely the grass is withered, the tender grass died out, There is no green thing. 

###### 7 
Therefore the abundance _which_ they have acquired and stored up They carry off over the brook of Arabim. 

###### 8 
For the cry of distress has gone around the territory of Moab, Its wail _goes_ as far as Eglaim and its wailing even to Beer-elim. 

###### 9 
For the waters of Dimon are full of blood; Surely I will bring added _woes_ upon Dimon, A lion upon the fugitives of Moab and upon the remnant of the land.
