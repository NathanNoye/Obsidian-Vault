###### 1 
The oracle concerning Babylon which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw. 

###### 2 
Lift up a standard on the bare hill, Raise your voice to them, Wave the hand that they may enter the doors of the nobles. 

###### 3 
I have commanded My consecrated ones, I have even called My mighty warriors, My proudly exulting ones, To _execute_ My anger. 

###### 4 
A sound of tumult on the mountains, Like that of many people! A sound of the uproar of kingdoms, Of nations gathered together! The LORD of hosts is mustering the army for battle. 

###### 5 
They are coming from a far country, From the farthest horizons, The LORD and His instruments of indignation, To destroy the whole land.Judgment on the Day of the LORD 

###### 6 
Wail, for the day of the LORD is near! It will come as destruction from the Almighty. 

###### 7 
Therefore all hands will fall limp, And every man's heart will melt. 

###### 8 
They will be terrified, Pains and anguish will take hold of _them_; They will writhe like a woman in labor, They will look at one another in astonishment, Their faces aflame. 

###### 9 
Behold, the day of the LORD is coming, Cruel, with fury and burning anger, To make the land a desolation; And He will exterminate its sinners from it. 

###### 10 
For the stars of heaven and their constellations Will not flash forth their light; The sun will be dark when it rises And the moon will not shed its light. 

###### 11 
Thus I will punish the world for its evil And the wicked for their iniquity; I will also put an end to the arrogance of the proud And abase the haughtiness of the ruthless. 

###### 12 
I will make mortal man scarcer than pure gold And mankind than the gold of Ophir. 

###### 13 
Therefore I will make the heavens tremble, And the earth will be shaken from its place At the fury of the LORD of hosts In the day of His burning anger. 

###### 14 
And it will be that like a hunted gazelle, Or like sheep with none to gather _them_, They will each turn to his own people, And each one flee to his own land. 

###### 15 
Anyone who is found will be thrust through, And anyone who is captured will fall by the sword. 

###### 16 
Their little ones also will be dashed to pieces Before their eyes; Their houses will be plundered And their wives ravished.Babylon Will Fall to the Medes 

###### 17 
Behold, I am going to stir up the Medes against them, Who will not value silver or take pleasure in gold. 

###### 18 
And _their_ bows will mow down the young men, They will not even have compassion on the fruit of the womb, _Nor_ will their eye pity children. 

###### 19 
And Babylon, the beauty of kingdoms, the glory of the Chaldeans' pride, Will be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 

###### 20 
It will never be inhabited or lived in from generation to generation; Nor will the Arab pitch _his_ tent there, Nor will shepherds make _their flocks_ lie down there. 

###### 21 
But desert creatures will lie down there, And their houses will be full of owls; Ostriches also will live there, and shaggy goats will frolic there. 

###### 22 
Hyenas will howl in their fortified towers And jackals in their luxurious palaces. Her _fateful_ time also will soon come And her days will not be prolonged.
