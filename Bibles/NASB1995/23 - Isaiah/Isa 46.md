###### 1 
Bel has bowed down, Nebo stoops over; Their images are _consigned_ to the beasts and the cattle. The things that you carry are burdensome, A load for the weary _beast_. 

###### 2 
They stooped over, they have bowed down together; They could not rescue the burden, But have themselves gone into captivity. 

###### 3 
"Listen to Me, O house of Jacob, And all the remnant of the house of Israel, You who have been borne by Me from birth And have been carried from the womb; 

###### 4 
Even to _your_ old age I will be the same, And even to _your_ graying years I will bear _you_! I have done _it_, and I will carry _you_; And I will bear _you_ and I will deliver _you_. 

###### 5 
"To whom would you liken Me And make Me equal and compare Me, That we would be alike? 

###### 6 
"Those who lavish gold from the purse And weigh silver on the scale Hire a goldsmith, and he makes it _into_ a god; They bow down, indeed they worship it. 

###### 7 
"They lift it upon the shoulder _and_ carry it; They set it in its place and it stands _there_. It does not move from its place. Though one may cry to it, it cannot answer; It cannot deliver him from his distress. 

###### 8 
"Remember this, and be assured; Recall it to mind, you transgressors. 

###### 9 
"Remember the former things long past, For I am God, and there is no other; _I am_ God, and there is no one like Me, 

###### 10 
Declaring the end from the beginning, And from ancient times things which have not been done, Saying, 'My purpose will be established, And I will accomplish all My good pleasure'; 

###### 11 
Calling a bird of prey from the east, The man of My purpose from a far country. Truly I have spoken; truly I will bring it to pass. I have planned _it, surely_ I will do it. 

###### 12 
"Listen to Me, you stubborn-minded, Who are far from righteousness. 

###### 13 
"I bring near My righteousness, it is not far off; And My salvation will not delay. And I will grant salvation in Zion, _And_ My glory for Israel.
