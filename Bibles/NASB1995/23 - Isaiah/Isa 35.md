###### 1 
The wilderness and the desert will be glad, And the Arabah will rejoice and blossom; Like the crocus 

###### 2 
It will blossom profusely And rejoice with rejoicing and shout of joy. The glory of Lebanon will be given to it, The majesty of Carmel and Sharon. They will see the glory of the LORD, The majesty of our God. 

###### 3 
Encourage the exhausted, and strengthen the feeble. 

###### 4 
Say to those with anxious heart, "Take courage, fear not. Behold, your God will come _with_ vengeance; The recompense of God will come, But He will save you." 

###### 5 
Then the eyes of the blind will be opened And the ears of the deaf will be unstopped. 

###### 6 
Then the lame will leap like a deer, And the tongue of the mute will shout for joy. For waters will break forth in the wilderness And streams in the Arabah. 

###### 7 
The scorched land will become a pool And the thirsty ground springs of water; In the haunt of jackals, its resting place, Grass _becomes_ reeds and rushes. 

###### 8 
A highway will be there, a roadway, And it will be called the Highway of Holiness. The unclean will not travel on it, But it _will_ be for him who walks _that_ way, And fools will not wander _on it_. 

###### 9 
No lion will be there, Nor will any vicious beast go up on it; These will not be found there. But the redeemed will walk _there_, 

###### 10 
And the ransomed of the LORD will return And come with joyful shouting to Zion, With everlasting joy upon their heads. They will find gladness and joy, And sorrow and sighing will flee away.
