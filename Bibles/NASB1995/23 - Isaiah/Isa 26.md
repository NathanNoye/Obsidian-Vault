###### 1 
In that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah: "We have a strong city; He sets up walls and ramparts for security. 

###### 2 
"Open the gates, that the righteous nation may enter, The one that remains faithful. 

###### 3 
"The steadfast of mind You will keep in perfect peace, Because he trusts in You. 

###### 4 
"Trust in the LORD forever, For in God the LORD, _we have_ an everlasting Rock. 

###### 5 
"For He has brought low those who dwell on high, the unassailable city; He lays it low, He lays it low to the ground, He casts it to the dust. 

###### 6 
"The foot will trample it, The feet of the afflicted, the steps of the helpless." 

###### 7 
The way of the righteous is smooth; O Upright One, make the path of the righteous level. 

###### 8 
Indeed, _while following_ the way of Your judgments, O LORD, We have waited for You eagerly; Your name, even Your memory, is the desire of _our_ souls. 

###### 9 
At night my soul longs for You, Indeed, my spirit within me seeks You diligently; For when the earth experiences Your judgments The inhabitants of the world learn righteousness. 

###### 10 
_Though_ the wicked is shown favor, He does not learn righteousness; He deals unjustly in the land of uprightness, And does not perceive the majesty of the LORD. 

###### 11 
O LORD, Your hand is lifted up _yet_ they do not see it. They see _Your_ zeal for the people and are put to shame; Indeed, fire will devour Your enemies. 

###### 12 
LORD, You will establish peace for us, Since You have also performed for us all our works. 

###### 13 
O LORD our God, other masters besides You have ruled us; _But_ through You alone we confess Your name. 

###### 14 
The dead will not live, the departed spirits will not rise; Therefore You have punished and destroyed them, And You have wiped out all remembrance of them. 

###### 15 
You have increased the nation, O LORD, You have increased the nation, You are glorified; You have extended all the borders of the land. 

###### 16 
O LORD, they sought You in distress; They could only whisper a prayer, Your chastening was upon them. 

###### 17 
As the pregnant woman approaches _the time_ to give birth, She writhes _and_ cries out in her labor pains, Thus were we before You, O LORD. 

###### 18 
We were pregnant, we writhed _in labor_, We gave birth, as it seems, _only_ to wind. We could not accomplish deliverance for the earth, Nor were inhabitants of the world born. 

###### 19 
Your dead will live; Their corpses will rise. You who lie in the dust, awake and shout for joy, For your dew _is as_ the dew of the dawn, And the earth will give birth to the departed spirits. 

###### 20 
Come, my people, enter into your rooms And close your doors behind you; Hide for a little while Until indignation runs _its_ course. 

###### 21 
For behold, the LORD is about to come out from His place To punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity; And the earth will reveal her bloodshed And will no longer cover her slain.
