###### 1 
"Cry loudly, do not hold back; Raise your voice like a trumpet, And declare to My people their transgression And to the house of Jacob their sins. 

###### 2 
"Yet they seek Me day by day and delight to know My ways, As a nation that has done righteousness And has not forsaken the ordinance of their God. They ask Me _for_ just decisions, They delight in the nearness of God. 

###### 3 
'Why have we fasted and You do not see? _Why_ have we humbled ourselves and You do not notice?' Behold, on the day of your fast you find _your_ desire, And drive hard all your workers. 

###### 4 
"Behold, you fast for contention and strife and to strike with a wicked fist. You do not fast like _you do_ today to make your voice heard on high. 

###### 5 
"Is it a fast like this which I choose, a day for a man to humble himself? Is it for bowing one's head like a reed And for spreading out sackcloth and ashes as a bed? Will you call this a fast, even an acceptable day to the LORD? 

###### 6 
"Is this not the fast which I choose, To loosen the bonds of wickedness, To undo the bands of the yoke, And to let the oppressed go free And break every yoke? 

###### 7 
"Is it not to divide your bread with the hungry And bring the homeless poor into the house; When you see the naked, to cover him; And not to hide yourself from your own flesh? 

###### 8 
"Then your light will break out like the dawn, And your recovery will speedily spring forth; And your righteousness will go before you; The glory of the LORD will be your rear guard. 

###### 9 
"Then you will call, and the LORD will answer; You will cry, and He will say, 'Here I am.' If you remove the yoke from your midst, The pointing of the finger and speaking wickedness, 

###### 10 
And if you give yourself to the hungry And satisfy the desire of the afflicted, Then your light will rise in darkness And your gloom _will become_ like midday. 

###### 11 
"And the LORD will continually guide you, And satisfy your desire in scorched places, And give strength to your bones; And you will be like a watered garden, And like a spring of water whose waters do not fail. 

###### 12 
"Those from among you will rebuild the ancient ruins; You will raise up the age-old foundations; And you will be called the repairer of the breach, The restorer of the streets in which to dwell.Keeping the Sabbath 

###### 13 
"If because of the sabbath, you turn your foot From doing your _own_ pleasure on My holy day, And call the sabbath a delight, the holy _day_ of the LORD honorable, And honor it, desisting from your _own_ ways, From seeking your _own_ pleasure And speaking _your own_ word, 

###### 14 
Then you will take delight in the LORD, And I will make you ride on the heights of the earth; And I will feed you _with_ the heritage of Jacob your father, For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."
