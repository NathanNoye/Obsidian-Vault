###### 1 
Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, 

###### 2 
"Son of man, how is the wood of the vine _better_ than any wood of a branch which is among the trees of the forest? 

###### 3 
Can wood be taken from it to make anything, or can _men_ take a peg from it on which to hang any vessel? 

###### 4 
If it has been put into the fire for fuel, _and_ the fire has consumed both of its ends and its middle part has been charred, is it _then_ useful for anything? 

###### 5 
Behold, while it is intact, it is not made into anything. How much less, when the fire has consumed it and it is charred, can it still be made into anything! 

###### 6 
Therefore, thus says the Lord God, 'As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem; 

###### 7 
and I set My face against them. _Though_ they have come out of the fire, yet the fire will consume them. Then you will know that I am the LORD, when I set My face against them. 

###### 8 
Thus I will make the land desolate, because they have acted unfaithfully,'" declares the Lord God.
