###### 1 
Now on the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle, he anointed it and consecrated it with all its furnishings and the altar and all its utensils; he anointed them and consecrated them also. 

###### 2 
Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers' households, made an offering (they were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the numbered men).

When they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen, a cart for _every_ two of the leaders and an ox for each one, then they presented them before the tabernacle. 

###### 4

"Accept _these things_ from them, that they may be used in the service of the tent of meeting, and you shall give them to the Levites, _to_ each man according to his service."
