###### 1 
I am the man who has seen affliction Because of the rod of His wrath. 

###### 2 
He has driven me and made me walk In darkness and not in light. 

###### 3 
Surely against me He has turned His hand Repeatedly all the day. 

###### 4 
He has caused my flesh and my skin to waste away, He has broken my bones. 

###### 5 
He has besieged and encompassed me with bitterness and hardship. 

###### 6 
In dark places He has made me dwell, Like those who have long been dead. 

###### 7 
He has walled me in so that I cannot go out; He has made my chain heavy. 

###### 8 
Even when I cry out and call for help, He shuts out my prayer. 

###### 9 
He has blocked my ways with hewn stone; He has made my paths crooked. 

###### 10 
He is to me like a bear lying in wait, _Like_ a lion in secret places. 

###### 11 
He has turned aside my ways and torn me to pieces; He has made me desolate. 

###### 12 
He bent His bow And set me as a target for the arrow. 

###### 13 
He made the arrows of His quiver To enter into my inward parts. 

###### 14 
I have become a laughingstock to all my people, Their _mocking_ song all the day. 

###### 15 
He has filled me with bitterness, He has made me drunk with wormwood. 

###### 16 
He has broken my teeth with gravel; He has made me cower in the dust. 

###### 17 
My soul has been rejected from peace; I have forgotten happiness. 

###### 18 
So I say, "My strength has perished, And _so has_ my hope from the LORD."Hope of Relief in God's Mercy 

###### 19 
Remember my affliction and my wandering, the wormwood and bitterness. 

###### 20 
Surely my soul remembers And is bowed down within me. 

###### 21 
This I recall to my mind, Therefore I have hope. 

###### 22 
The Lord's lovingkindnesses indeed never cease, For His compassions never fail. 

###### 23 
_They_ are new every morning; Great is Your faithfulness. 

###### 24 
"The LORD is my portion," says my soul, "Therefore I have hope in Him." 

###### 25 
The LORD is good to those who wait for Him, To the person who seeks Him. 

###### 26 
_It is_ good that he waits silently For the salvation of the LORD. 

###### 27 
_It is_ good for a man that he should bear The yoke in his youth. 

###### 28 
Let him sit alone and be silent Since He has laid _it_ on him. 

###### 29 
Let him put his mouth in the dust, Perhaps there is hope. 

###### 30 
Let him give his cheek to the smiter, Let him be filled with reproach. 

###### 31 
For the Lord will not reject forever, 

###### 32 
For if He causes grief, Then He will have compassion According to His abundant lovingkindness. 

###### 33 
For He does not afflict willingly Or grieve the sons of men. 

###### 34 
To crush under His feet All the prisoners of the land, 

###### 35 
To deprive a man of justice In the presence of the Most High, 

###### 36 
To defraud a man in his lawsuit-- Of these things the Lord does not approve. 

###### 37 
Who is there who speaks and it comes to pass, Unless the Lord has commanded _it_? 

###### 38 
_Is it_ not from the mouth of the Most High That both good and ill go forth? 

###### 39 
Why should _any_ living mortal, or _any_ man, Offer complaint in view of his sins? 

###### 40 
Let us examine and probe our ways, And let us return to the LORD. 

###### 41 
We lift up our heart and hands Toward God in heaven; 

###### 42 
We have transgressed and rebelled, You have not pardoned. 

###### 43 
You have covered _Yourself_ with anger And pursued us; You have slain _and_ have not spared. 

###### 44 
You have covered Yourself with a cloud So that no prayer can pass through. 

###### 45 
_You have made us mere_ offscouring and refuse In the midst of the peoples. 

###### 46 
All our enemies have opened their mouths against us. 

###### 47 
Panic and pitfall have befallen us, Devastation and destruction; 

###### 48 
My eyes run down with streams of water Because of the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 49 
My eyes pour down unceasingly, Without stopping, 

###### 50 
Until the LORD looks down And sees from heaven. 

###### 51 
My eyes bring pain to my soul Because of all the daughters of my city. 

###### 52 
My enemies without cause Hunted me down like a bird; 

###### 53 
They have silenced me in the pit And have placed a stone on me. 

###### 54 
Waters flowed over my head; I said, "I am cut off!" 

###### 55 
I called on Your name, O LORD, Out of the lowest pit. 

###### 56 
You have heard my voice, "Do not hide Your ear from my _prayer for_ relief, From my cry for help." 

###### 57 
You drew near when I called on You; You said, "Do not fear!" 

###### 58 
O Lord, You have pleaded my soul's cause; You have redeemed my life. 

###### 59 
O LORD, You have seen my oppression; Judge my case. 

###### 60 
You have seen all their vengeance, All their schemes against me. 

###### 61 
You have heard their reproach, O LORD, All their schemes against me. 

###### 62 
The lips of my assailants and their whispering _Are_ against me all day long. 

###### 63 
Look on their sitting and their rising; I am their mocking song. 

###### 64 
You will recompense them, O LORD, According to the work of their hands. 

###### 65 
You will give them hardness of heart, Your curse will be on them. 

###### 66 
You will pursue them in anger and destroy them From under the heavens of the LORD!
