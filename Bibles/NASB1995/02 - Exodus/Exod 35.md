Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came _and_ brought the Lord's contribution for the work of the tent of meeting and for all its service and for the holy garments. 

###### 22

All the skilled women spun with their hands, and brought what they had spun, _in_ blue and purple _and_ scarlet _material_ and _in_ fine linen. 

###### 26 
All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats' _hair_. 

###### 27 
The rulers brought the onyx stones and the stones for setting for the ephod and for the breastpiece; 

###### 28 
and the spice and the oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense.

The Israelites, all the men and women, whose heart moved them to bring _material_ for all the work, which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill offering to the LORD. 

###### 30 
Then Moses said to the sons of Israel, "See, the LORD has called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 

###### 31 
And He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding and in knowledge and in all craftsmanship; 

###### 32 
to make designs for working in gold and in silver and in bronze, 

###### 33 
and in the cutting of stones for settings and in the carving of wood, so as to perform in every inventive work.

###### 35 
He has filled them with skill to perform every work of an engraver and of a designer and of an embroiderer, in blue and in purple _and_ in scarlet _material_, and in fine linen, and of a weaver, as performers of every work and makers of designs.
