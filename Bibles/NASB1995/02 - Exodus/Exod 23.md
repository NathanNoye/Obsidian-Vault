###### 1 
"You shall not bear a false report; do not join your hand with a wicked man to be a malicious witness. 

###### 2 
You shall not follow the masses in doing evil, nor shall you testify in a dispute so as to turn aside after a multitude in order to pervert _justice_; 

###### 3 
nor shall you be partial to a poor man in his dispute. 

###### 4 
"If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey wandering away, you shall surely return it to him. 

###### 5 
If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying _helpless_ under its load, you shall refrain from leaving it to him, you shall surely release _it_ with him. 

###### 6 
"You shall not pervert the justice _due_ to your needy _brother_ in his dispute. 

###### 7 
Keep far from a false charge, and do not kill the innocent or the righteous, for I will not acquit the guilty. 

###### 8 
"You shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the cause of the just. 

###### 9 
"You shall not oppress a stranger, since you yourselves know the feelings of a stranger, for you _also_ were strangers in the land of Egypt.The Sabbath and Land 

###### 10 
"You shall sow your land for six years and gather in its yield, 

###### 11 
but _on_ the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow, so that the needy of your people may eat; and whatever they leave the beast of the field may eat. You are to do the same with your vineyard _and_ your olive grove. 

###### 12 
"Six days you are to do your work, but on the seventh day you shall cease _from labor_ so that your ox and your donkey may rest, and the son of your female slave, as well as your stranger, may refresh themselves. 

###### 13 
Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be on your guard; and do not mention the name of other gods, nor let _them_ be heard from your mouth.Three National Feasts 

###### 14 
"Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast to Me. 

###### 15 
You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days you are to eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. And none shall appear before Me empty-handed. 

###### 16 
Also _you shall observe_ the Feast of the Harvest _of_ the first fruits of your labors _from_ what you sow in the field; also the Feast of the Ingathering at the end of the year when you gather in _the fruit of_ your labors from the field. 

###### 17 
Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord God. 

###### 18 
"You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; nor is the fat of My feast to remain overnight until morning. 

###### 19 
"You shall bring the choice first fruits of your soil into the house of the LORD your God. "You are not to boil a young goat in the milk of its mother.Conquest of the Land 

###### 20 
"Behold, I am going to send an angel before you to guard you along the way and to bring you into the place which I have prepared. 

###### 21 
Be on your guard before him and obey his voice; do not be rebellious toward him, for he will not pardon your transgression, since My name is in him. 

###### 22 
But if you truly obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. 

###### 23 
For My angel will go before you and bring you in to _the land of_ the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites and the Jebusites; and I will completely destroy them. 

###### 24 
You shall not worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do according to their deeds; but you shall utterly overthrow them and break their _sacred_ pillars in pieces. 

###### 25 
But you shall serve the LORD your God, and He will bless your bread and your water; and I will remove sickness from your midst. 

###### 26 
There shall be no one miscarrying or barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days. 

###### 27 
I will send My terror ahead of you, and throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn _their_ backs to you. 

###### 28 
I will send hornets ahead of you so that they will drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites before you. 

###### 29 
I will not drive them out before you in a single year, that the land may not become desolate and the beasts of the field become too numerous for you. 

###### 30 
I will drive them out before you little by little, until you become fruitful and take possession of the land. 

###### 31 
I will fix your boundary from the Red Sea to the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River _Euphrates_; for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand, and you will drive them out before you. 

###### 32 
You shall make no covenant with them or with their gods. 

###### 33 
They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me; for _if_ you serve their gods, it will surely be a snare to you."
