###### 1 
"In the first year of Darius the Mede, I arose to be an encouragement and a protection for him. 

###### 2 
And now I will tell you the truth. Behold, three more kings are going to arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain far more riches than all _of them_; as soon as he becomes strong through his riches, he will arouse the whole _empire_ against the realm of Greece. 

###### 3 
And a mighty king will arise, and he will rule with great authority and do as he pleases. 

###### 4 
But as soon as he has arisen, his kingdom will be broken up and parceled out toward the four points of the compass, though not to his _own_ descendants, nor according to his authority which he wielded, for his sovereignty will be uprooted and _given_ to others besides them. 

###### 5 
"Then the king of the South will grow strong, along with _one_ of his princes who will gain ascendancy over him and obtain dominion; his domain _will be_ a great dominion _indeed_. 

###### 6 
After some years they will form an alliance, and the daughter of the king of the South will come to the king of the North to carry out a peaceful arrangement. But she will not retain her position of power, nor will he remain with his power, but she will be given up, along with those who brought her in and the one who sired her as well as he who supported her in _those_ times. 

###### 7 
But one of the descendants of her line will arise in his place, and he will come against _their_ army and enter the fortress of the king of the North, and he will deal with them and display _great_ strength. 

###### 8 
Also their gods with their metal images _and_ their precious vessels of silver and gold he will take into captivity to Egypt, and he on his part will refrain from _attacking_ the king of the North for _some_ years. 

###### 9 
Then the latter will enter the realm of the king of the South, but will return to his _own_ land. 

###### 10 
"His sons will mobilize and assemble a multitude of great forces; and one of them will keep on coming and overflow and pass through, that he may again wage war up to his _very_ fortress. 

###### 11 
The king of the South will be enraged and go forth and fight with the king of the North. Then the latter will raise a great multitude, but _that_ multitude will be given into the hand of the _former_. 

###### 12 
When the multitude is carried away, his heart will be lifted up, and he will cause tens of thousands to fall; yet he will not prevail. 

###### 13 
For the king of the North will again raise a greater multitude than the former, and after an interval of some years he will press on with a great army and much equipment. 

###### 14 
"Now in those times many will rise up against the king of the South; the violent ones among your people will also lift themselves up in order to fulfill the vision, but they will fall down. 

###### 15 
Then the king of the North will come, cast up a siege ramp and capture a well-fortified city; and the forces of the South will not stand _their ground_, not even their choicest troops, for there will be no strength to make a stand. 

###### 16 
But he who comes against him will do as he pleases, and no one will _be able to_ withstand him; he will also stay _for a time_ in the Beautiful Land, with destruction in his hand. 

###### 17 
He will set his face to come with the power of his whole kingdom, bringing with him a proposal of peace which he will put into effect; he will also give him the daughter of women to ruin it. But she will not take a stand _for him_ or be on his side. 

###### 18 
Then he will turn his face to the coastlands and capture many. But a commander will put a stop to his scorn against him; moreover, he will repay him for his scorn. 

###### 19 
So he will turn his face toward the fortresses of his own land, but he will stumble and fall and be found no more. 

###### 20 
"Then in his place one will arise who will send an oppressor through the Jewel of _his_ kingdom; yet within a few days he will be shattered, though not in anger nor in battle. 

###### 21 
In his place a despicable person will arise, on whom the honor of kingship has not been conferred, but he will come in a time of tranquility and seize the kingdom by intrigue. 

###### 22 
The overflowing forces will be flooded away before him and shattered, and also the prince of the covenant. 

###### 23 
After an alliance is made with him he will practice deception, and he will go up and gain power with a small _force of_ people. 

###### 24 
In a time of tranquility he will enter the richest _parts_ of the realm, and he will accomplish what his fathers never did, nor his ancestors; he will distribute plunder, booty and possessions among them, and he will devise his schemes against strongholds, but _only_ for a time. 

###### 25 
He will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the South with a large army; so the king of the South will mobilize an extremely large and mighty army for war; but he will not stand, for schemes will be devised against him. 

###### 26 
Those who eat his choice food will destroy him, and his army will overflow, but many will fall down slain. 

###### 27 
As for both kings, their hearts will be _intent_ on evil, and they will speak lies _to each other_ at the same table; but it will not succeed, for the end is still _to come_ at the appointed time. 

###### 28 
Then he will return to his land with much plunder; but his heart will be _set_ against the holy covenant, and he will take action and _then_ return to his _own_ land. 

###### 29 
"At the appointed time he will return and come into the South, but this last time it will not turn out the way it did before. 

###### 30 
For ships of Kittim will come against him; therefore he will be disheartened and will return and become enraged at the holy covenant and take action; so he will come back and show regard for those who forsake the holy covenant. 

###### 31 
Forces from him will arise, desecrate the sanctuary fortress, and do away with the regular sacrifice. And they will set up the abomination of desolation. 

###### 32 
By smooth _words_ he will turn to godlessness those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but the people who know their God will display strength and take action. 

###### 33 
Those who have insight among the people will give understanding to the many; yet they will fall by sword and by flame, by captivity and by plunder for _many_ days. 

###### 34 
Now when they fall they will be granted a little help, and many will join with them in hypocrisy. 

###### 35 
Some of those who have insight will fall, in order to refine, purge and make them pure until the end time; because _it is_ still _to come_ at the appointed time. 

###### 36 
"Then the king will do as he pleases, and he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will speak monstrous things against the God of gods; and he will prosper until the indignation is finished, for that which is decreed will be done. 

###### 37 
He will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the desire of women, nor will he show regard for any _other_ god; for he will magnify himself above _them_ all. 

###### 38 
But instead he will honor a god of fortresses, a god whom his fathers did not know; he will honor _him_ with gold, silver, costly stones and treasures. 

###### 39 
He will take action against the strongest of fortresses with _the help of_ a foreign god; he will give great honor to those who acknowledge _him_ and will cause them to rule over the many, and will parcel out land for a price. 

###### 40 
"At the end time the king of the South will collide with him, and the king of the North will storm against him with chariots, with horsemen and with many ships; and he will enter countries, overflow _them_ and pass through. 

###### 41 
He will also enter the Beautiful Land, and many _countries_ will fall; but these will be rescued out of his hand: Edom, Moab and the foremost of the sons of Ammon. 

###### 42 
Then he will stretch out his hand against _other_ countries, and the land of Egypt will not escape. 

###### 43 
But he will gain control over the hidden treasures of gold and silver and over all the precious things of Egypt; and Libyans and Ethiopians _will follow_ at his heels. 

###### 44 
But rumors from the East and from the North will disturb him, and he will go forth with great wrath to destroy and annihilate many. 

###### 45 
He will pitch the tents of his royal pavilion between the seas and the beautiful Holy Mountain; yet he will come to his end, and no one will help him.
