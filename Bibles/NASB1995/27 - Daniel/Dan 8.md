###### 1 
In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king a vision appeared to me, Daniel, subsequent to the one which appeared to me previously. 

###### 2 
I looked in the vision, and while I was looking I was in the citadel of Susa, which is in the province of Elam; and I looked in the vision and I myself was beside the Ulai Canal. 

###### 3 
Then I lifted my eyes and looked, and behold, a ram which had two horns was standing in front of the canal. Now the two horns _were_ long, but one _was_ longer than the other, with the longer one coming up last. 

###### 4 
I saw the ram butting westward, northward, and southward, and no _other_ beasts could stand before him nor was there anyone to rescue from his power, but he did as he pleased and magnified _himself_. 

###### 5 
While I was observing, behold, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the whole earth without touching the ground; and the goat _had_ a conspicuous horn between his eyes. 

###### 6 
He came up to the ram that had the two horns, which I had seen standing in front of the canal, and rushed at him in his mighty wrath. 

###### 7 
I saw him come beside the ram, and he was enraged at him; and he struck the ram and shattered his two horns, and the ram had no strength to withstand him. So he hurled him to the ground and trampled on him, and there was none to rescue the ram from his power. 

###### 8 
Then the male goat magnified _himself_ exceedingly. But as soon as he was mighty, the large horn was broken; and in its place there came up four conspicuous _horns_ toward the four winds of heaven.The Little Horn 

###### 9 
Out of one of them came forth a rather small horn which grew exceedingly great toward the south, toward the east, and toward the Beautiful _Land_. 

###### 10 
It grew up to the host of heaven and caused some of the host and some of the stars to fall to the earth, and it trampled them down. 

###### 11 
It even magnified _itself_ to be equal with the Commander of the host; and it removed the regular sacrifice from Him, and the place of His sanctuary was thrown down. 

###### 12 
And on account of transgression the host will be given over _to the horn_ along with the regular sacrifice; and it will fling truth to the ground and perform _its will_ and prosper. 

###### 13 
Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to that particular one who was speaking, "How long will the vision _about_ the regular sacrifice apply, while the transgression causes horror, so as to allow both the holy place and the host to be trampled?" 

###### 14 
He said to me, "For 2,300 evenings _and_ mornings; then the holy place will be properly restored."Interpretation of the Vision 

###### 15 
When I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I sought to understand it; and behold, standing before me was one who looked like a man. 

###### 16 
And I heard the voice of a man between _the banks of_ Ulai, and he called out and said, "Gabriel, give this _man_ an understanding of the vision." 

###### 17 
So he came near to where I was standing, and when he came I was frightened and fell on my face; but he said to me, "Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end." 

###### 18 
Now while he was talking with me, I sank into a deep sleep with my face to the ground; but he touched me and made me stand upright. 

###### 19 
He said, "Behold, I am going to let you know what will occur at the final period of the indignation, for _it_ pertains to the appointed time of the end.The Ram's Identity 

###### 20 
The ram which you saw with the two horns represents the kings of Media and Persia.The Goat 

###### 21 
The shaggy goat _represents_ the kingdom of Greece, and the large horn that is between his eyes is the first king. 

###### 22 
The broken _horn_ and the four _horns that_ arose in its place _represent_ four kingdoms _which_ will arise from _his_ nation, although not with his power. 

###### 23 
"In the latter period of their rule, When the transgressors have run _their course_, A king will arise, Insolent and skilled in intrigue. 

###### 24 
"His power will be mighty, but not by his _own_ power, And he will destroy to an extraordinary degree And prosper and perform _his will_; He will destroy mighty men and the holy people. 

###### 25 
"And through his shrewdness He will cause deceit to succeed by his influence; And he will magnify _himself_ in his heart, And he will destroy many while _they are_ at ease. He will even oppose the Prince of princes, But he will be broken without human agency. 

###### 26 
"The vision of the evenings and mornings Which has been told is true; But keep the vision secret, For _it_ pertains to many days _in the future_." 

###### 27 
Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and sick for days. Then I got up _again_ and carried on the king's business; but I was astounded at the vision, and there was none to explain _it_.
