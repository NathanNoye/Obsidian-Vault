###### 1 
Masters, grant to your slaves justice and fairness, knowing that you too have a Master in heaven. 

###### 2 
Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with _an attitude of_ thanksgiving; 

###### 3 
praying at the same time for us as well, that God will open up to us a door for the word, so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I have also been imprisoned; 

###### 4 
that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak. 

###### 5 
Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity. 

###### 6 
Let your speech always be with grace, _as though_ seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person. 

###### 7 
As to all my affairs, Tychicus, _our_ beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow bond-servant in the Lord, will bring you information. 

###### 8 
_For_ I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts; 

###### 9 
and with him Onesimus, _our_ faithful and beloved brother, who is one of your _number_. They will inform you about the whole situation here. 

###### 10 
Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends you his greetings; and _also_ Barnabas's cousin Mark (about whom you received instructions; if he comes to you, welcome him); 

###### 11 
and _also_ Jesus who is called Justus; these are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God who are from the circumcision, and they have proved to be an encouragement to me. 

###### 12 
Epaphras, who is one of your number, a bondslave of Jesus Christ, sends you his greetings, always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. 

###### 13 
For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for those who are in Laodicea and Hierapolis. 

###### 14 
Luke, the beloved physician, sends you his greetings, and _also_ Demas. 

###### 15 
Greet the brethren who are in Laodicea and also Nympha and the church that is in her house. 

###### 16 
When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and you, for your part read my letter _that is coming_ from Laodicea. 

###### 17 
Say to Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it." 

###### 18 
I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my imprisonment. Grace be with you.
