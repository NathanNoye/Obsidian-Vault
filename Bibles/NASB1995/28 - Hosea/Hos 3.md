###### 1 
Then the LORD said to me, "Go again, love a woman _who_ is loved by _her_ husband, yet an adulteress, even as the LORD loves the sons of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes." 

###### 2 
So I bought her for myself for fifteen _shekels_ of silver and a homer and a half of barley. 

###### 3 
Then I said to her, "You shall stay with me for many days. You shall not play the harlot, nor shall you have a man; so I will also be toward you." 

###### 4 
For the sons of Israel will remain for many days without king or prince, without sacrifice or _sacred_ pillar and without ephod or household idols. 

###### 5 
Afterward the sons of Israel will return and seek the LORD their God and David their king; and they will come trembling to the LORD and to His goodness in the last days.
