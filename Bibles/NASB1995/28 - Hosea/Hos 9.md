###### 1 
Do not rejoice, O Israel, with exultation like the nations! For you have played the harlot, forsaking your God. You have loved _harlots_' earnings on every threshing floor. 

###### 2 
Threshing floor and wine press will not feed them, And the new wine will fail them. 

###### 3 
They will not remain in the Lord's land, But Ephraim will return to Egypt, And in Assyria they will eat unclean _food_. 

###### 4 
They will not pour out drink offerings of wine to the LORD, Their sacrifices will not please Him. _Their bread will_ _be_ like mourners' bread; All who eat of it will be defiled, For their bread will be for themselves _alone_; It will not enter the house of the LORD. 

###### 5 
What will you do on the day of the appointed festival And on the day of the feast of the LORD? 

###### 6 
For behold, they will go because of destruction; Egypt will gather them up, Memphis will bury them. Weeds will take over their treasures of silver; Thorns _will be_ in their tents. 

###### 7 
The days of punishment have come, The days of retribution have come; Let Israel know _this_! The prophet is a fool, The inspired man is demented, Because of the grossness of your iniquity, And _because_ your hostility is _so_ great. 

###### 8 
Ephraim _was_ a watchman with my God, a prophet; _Yet_ the snare of a bird catcher is in all his ways, _And_ there is _only_ hostility in the house of his God. 

###### 9 
They have gone deep in depravity As in the days of Gibeah; He will remember their iniquity, He will punish their sins. 

###### 10 
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your forefathers as the earliest fruit on the fig tree in its first _season_. _But_ they came to Baal-peor and devoted themselves to shame, And they became as detestable as that which they loved. 

###### 11 
As for Ephraim, their glory will fly away like a bird-- No birth, no pregnancy and no conception! 

###### 12 
Though they bring up their children, Yet I will bereave them until not a man is left. Yes, woe to them indeed when I depart from them! 

###### 13 
Ephraim, as I have seen, Is planted in a pleasant meadow like Tyre; But Ephraim will bring out his children for slaughter. 

###### 14 
Give them, O LORD--what will You give? Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. 

###### 15 
All their evil is at Gilgal; Indeed, I came to hate them there! Because of the wickedness of their deeds I will drive them out of My house! I will love them no more; All their princes are rebels. 

###### 16 
Ephraim is stricken, their root is dried up, They will bear no fruit. Even though they bear children, I will slay the precious ones of their womb. 

###### 17 
My God will cast them away Because they have not listened to Him; And they will be wanderers among the nations.
