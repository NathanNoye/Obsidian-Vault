###### 1 
_Put_ the trumpet to your lips! Like an eagle _the enemy comes_ against the house of the LORD, Because they have transgressed My covenant And rebelled against My law. 

###### 2 
They cry out to Me, "My God, we of Israel know You!" 

###### 3 
Israel has rejected the good; The enemy will pursue him. 

###### 4 
They have set up kings, but not by Me; They have appointed princes, but I did not know _it_. With their silver and gold they have made idols for themselves, That they might be cut off. 

###### 5 
He has rejected your calf, O Samaria, _saying_, "My anger burns against them!" How long will they be incapable of innocence? 

###### 6 
For from Israel is even this! A craftsman made it, so it is not God; Surely the calf of Samaria will be broken to pieces. 

###### 7 
For they sow the wind And they reap the whirlwind. The standing grain has no heads; It yields no grain. Should it yield, strangers would swallow it up. 

###### 8 
Israel is swallowed up; They are now among the nations Like a vessel in which no one delights. 

###### 9 
For they have gone up to Assyria, _Like_ a wild donkey all alone; Ephraim has hired lovers. 

###### 10 
Even though they hire _allies_ among the nations, Now I will gather them up; And they will begin to diminish Because of the burden of the king of princes. 

###### 11 
Since Ephraim has multiplied altars for sin, They have become altars of sinning for him. 

###### 12 
Though I wrote for him ten thousand _precepts_ of My law, They are regarded as a strange thing. 

###### 13 
As for My sacrificial gifts, They sacrifice the flesh and eat _it_, _But_ the LORD has taken no delight in them. Now He will remember their iniquity, And punish _them_ for their sins; They will return to Egypt. 

###### 14 
For Israel has forgotten his Maker and built palaces; And Judah has multiplied fortified cities, But I will send a fire on its cities that it may consume its palatial dwellings.
