###### 1 
Ephraim feeds on wind, And pursues the east wind continually; He multiplies lies and violence. Moreover, he makes a covenant with Assyria, And oil is carried to Egypt. 

###### 2 
The LORD also has a dispute with Judah, And will punish Jacob according to his ways; He will repay him according to his deeds. 

###### 3 
In the womb he took his brother by the heel, And in his maturity he contended with God. 

###### 4 
Yes, he wrestled with the angel and prevailed; He wept and sought His favor. He found Him at Bethel And there He spoke with us, 

###### 5 
Even the LORD, the God of hosts, The LORD is His name. 

###### 6 
Therefore, return to your God, Observe kindness and justice, And wait for your God continually. 

###### 7 
A merchant, in whose hands are false balances, He loves to oppress. 

###### 8 
And Ephraim said, "Surely I have become rich, I have found wealth for myself; In all my labors they will find in me No iniquity, which _would be_ sin." 

###### 9 
But I _have been_ the LORD your God since the land of Egypt; I will make you live in tents again, As in the days of the appointed festival. 

###### 10 
I have also spoken to the prophets, And I gave numerous visions, And through the prophets I gave parables. 

###### 11 
Is there iniquity _in_ Gilead? Surely they are worthless. In Gilgal they sacrifice bulls, Yes, their altars are like the stone heaps Beside the furrows of the field. 

###### 12 
Now Jacob fled to the land of Aram, And Israel worked for a wife, And for a wife he kept _sheep_. 

###### 13 
But by a prophet the LORD brought Israel from Egypt, And by a prophet he was kept. 

###### 14 
Ephraim has provoked to bitter anger; So his Lord will leave his bloodguilt on him And bring back his reproach to him.
