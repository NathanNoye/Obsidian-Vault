###### 1 
Israel is a luxuriant vine; He produces fruit for himself. The more his fruit, The more altars he made; The richer his land, The better he made the _sacred_ pillars. 

###### 2 
Their heart is faithless; Now they must bear their guilt. The LORD will break down their altars _And_ destroy their _sacred_ pillars. 

###### 3 
Surely now they will say, "We have no king, For we do not revere the LORD. As for the king, what can he do for us?" 

###### 4 
They speak _mere_ words, With worthless oaths they make covenants; And judgment sprouts like poisonous weeds in the furrows of the field. 

###### 5 
The inhabitants of Samaria will fear For the calf of Beth-aven. Indeed, its people will mourn for it, And its idolatrous priests will cry out over it, Over its glory, since it has departed from it. 

###### 6 
The thing itself will be carried to Assyria As tribute to King Jareb; Ephraim will be seized with shame And Israel will be ashamed of its own counsel. 

###### 7 
Samaria will be cut off _with_ her king Like a stick on the surface of the water. 

###### 8 
Also the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel, will be destroyed; Thorn and thistle will grow on their altars; Then they will say to the mountains, "Cover us!" And to the hills, "Fall on us!" 

###### 9 
From the days of Gibeah you have sinned, O Israel; There they stand! Will not the battle against the sons of iniquity overtake them in Gibeah? 

###### 10 
When it is My desire, I will chastise them; And the peoples will be gathered against them When they are bound for their double guilt. 

###### 11 
Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh, But I will come over her fair neck _with a yoke_; I will harness Ephraim, Judah will plow, Jacob will harrow for himself. 

###### 12 
Sow with a view to righteousness, Reap in accordance with kindness; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD Until He comes to rain righteousness on you. 

###### 13 
You have plowed wickedness, you have reaped injustice, You have eaten the fruit of lies. Because you have trusted in your way, in your numerous warriors, 

###### 14 
Therefore a tumult will arise among your people, And all your fortresses will be destroyed, As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel on the day of battle, _When_ mothers were dashed in pieces with _their_ children. 

###### 15 
Thus it will be done to you at Bethel because of your great wickedness. At dawn the king of Israel will be completely cut off.
