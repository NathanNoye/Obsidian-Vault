###### 1 
I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse, I gathered my myrrh with my spice: I ate mine honeycomb with mine honey, I drank my wine with my milk: eat, O friends, drink, and make you merry, O well-beloved. 

###### 2 
I sleep, but mine heart waketh, _it is_ the voice of my well-beloved that knocketh, _saying_, Open unto me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for mine head is full of dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. 

###### 3 
I have put off my coat, how shall I defile [put] it on? I have washed my feet, how shall I defile them? 

###### 4 
My well-beloved put in his hand by the hole _of the door_, and mine heart was affectioned toward him. 

###### 5 
I rose up to open to my well-beloved, and mine hands did drop down myrrh, and my fingers pure myrrh upon the handles of the bar. 

###### 6 
I opened to my well-beloved: but my well-beloved was gone and past: mine heart was gone when he did speak: I sought him, but I could not find him: I called him, but he answered me not. 

###### 7 
The watchmen that were about the city, found me: they smote me, _and_ wounded me: the watchmen of the walls took away my veil from me. 

###### 8 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you find my well-beloved, that you tell him that I am sick of love. 

###### 9 
O the fairest among women, what is thy well-beloved more than _other_ well-beloved? what is thy well-beloved more than _another_ lover, that thou dost so charge us? 

###### 10 
My well-beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest of ten thousand. 

###### 11 
His head _is as_ fine gold, his locks curled, _and_ black as a raven. 

###### 12 
His eyes _are_ like doves upon the rivers of waters, which are washed with milk, _and_ remain by the full _vessels_. 

###### 13 
His cheeks _are_ as a bed of spices, _and as_ sweet flowers, _and_ his lips _like_ lilies dropping down pure myrrh. 

###### 14 
His hands _as_ rings of gold set with the chrysolite, his belly like white ivory covered with sapphires. 

###### 15 
His legs _are as_ pillars of marble set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. 

###### 16 
His mouth _is as_ sweet things, and he is wholly delectable: this is my well-beloved, and this is my lover, O daughters of Jerusalem. 

###### 17 
O the fairest among women, whither is thy well-beloved gone? whither is thy well-beloved turned aside, that we may seek him with thee?
