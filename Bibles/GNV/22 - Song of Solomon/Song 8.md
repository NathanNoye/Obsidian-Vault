###### 1 
Oh that thou werest as my brother that sucked the breasts of my mother: I would find thee without, I would kiss thee, then they should not despise thee. 

###### 2 
I will lead thee _and_ bring thee into my mother's house: _there_ thou shalt teach me: _and_ I will cause thee to drink spiced wine, _and_ new wine of the pomegranate. 

###### 3 
His left hand _shall be_ under mine head, and his right hand shall embrace me. 

###### 4 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that you stir not up, nor waken _my_ love until she please. 

###### 5 
(Who is this that cometh up out of the wilderness, leaning upon her well-beloved?) I raised thee up under an apple tree: there the mother conceived thee: there she conceived that bare thee. 

###### 6 
Set me as a seal on thine heart, _and_ as a signet upon thine arm: for love _is_ strong as death: jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof _are_ fiery coals, _and_ a vehement flame. 

###### 7 
Much water cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man should give all the substance of his house for love, they would greatly contemn it. 

###### 8 
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister when she shall be spoken for? 

###### 9 
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a silver palace: and if she be a door, we will keep her in with boards of cedar. 

###### 10 
I am a wall, and my breasts _are_ as towers: then was I in his eyes as one that findeth peace. 

###### 11 
Solomon had a vine in Baal Hamon: he gave the vineyard unto keepers: everyone bringeth for the fruit thereof a thousand _pieces_ of silver. 

###### 12 
_But_ my vineyard which is mine, _is_ before me: to thee, O Solomon, _appertaineth_ a thousand _pieces of silver_, and two hundred to them that keep the fruit thereof. 

###### 13 
O thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken unto thy voice: cause me to hear it. 

###### 14 
O my well-beloved, flee away and be like unto the roe, or to the young hart upon the mountains of spices.
