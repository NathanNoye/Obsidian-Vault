###### 1 
I am the rose of the field, _and_ the lily of the valleys. 

###### 2 
Like a lily among the thorns, so _is_ my love among the daughters. 

###### 3 
Like the apple tree among the trees of the forest, so _is_ my well-beloved among the sons _of men_: under his shadow had I delight, and sat down: and his fruit _was_ sweet unto my mouth. 

###### 4 
He brought me into the wine cellar, and love _was_ his banner over me. 

###### 5 
Stay me with flagons, and comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love. 

###### 6 
His left hand _is_ under mine head, and his right hand doth embrace me. 

###### 7 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor waken _my_ love, until she please. 

###### 8 
_It is_ the voice of my well-beloved: behold, he cometh leaping by the mountains, and skipping by the hills. 

###### 9 
My well-beloved is like a roe, or a young hart: lo, he standeth behind our wall, looking forth of the windows, showing himself through the grates. 

###### 10 
My well-beloved spake and said unto me, Arise, my love, my fair one, and come thy way. 

###### 11 
For behold, winter is past: the rain is changed, and is gone away. 

###### 12 
The flowers appear in the earth: the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land. 

###### 13 
The fig tree hath brought forth her young figs: and the vines with _their_ small grapes have cast a savor: arise my love, my fair one, and come away. 

###### 14 
My dove, that art in the holes of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, show me thy sight, let me hear thy voice: for thy voice is sweet, and thy sight comely. 

###### 15 
Take us the foxes, the little foxes, which destroy the vines: for our vines _have_ small grapes. 

###### 16 
My well-beloved _is _mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies, 

###### 17 
Until the daybreak, and the shadows flee away: return, my well-beloved, _and_ be like a roe, or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
