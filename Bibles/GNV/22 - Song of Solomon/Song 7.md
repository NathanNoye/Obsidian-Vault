###### 1 
How beautiful are thy goings with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs _are_ like jewels: the work of the hand of a cunning workman. 

###### 2 
Thy navel _is as_ a round cup that wanteth not liquor: thy belly _is as_ an heap of wheat compassed about with lilies. 

###### 3 
Thy two breasts _are_ as two young roes that are twins. 

###### 4 
Thy neck _is_ like a tower of ivory; thine eyes _are like_ the fish pools in Heshbon by the gate of Bath Rabbim: thy nose _is_ as the tower of Lebanon that looketh toward Damascus. 

###### 5 
Thine head upon thee _is_ as scarlet, and the bush of thine head like purple: the king _is_ tied in the rafters. 

###### 6 
How fair art thou, and how pleasant art thou, O _my_ love, in pleasures! 

###### 7 
This thy stature is like a palm tree, and thy breasts like clusters. 

###### 8 
I said, I will go up into the palm tree, I will take hold of her boughs: thy breasts shall now be like the clusters of the vine: and the savor of thy nose like apples, 

###### 9 
And the roof of thy mouth like good wine, which goeth straight to my well-beloved, and causeth the lips of the ancient to speak. 

###### 10 
I am my well-beloved's, and his desire is toward me. 

###### 11 
Come my well-beloved, let us go forth into the field: let us remain in the villages. 

###### 12 
Let us get up early to the vines, let us see if the vine flourish, _whither_ it hath budded the small grape, _or whither_ the pomegranates flourish: there will I give thee my love. 

###### 13 
The mandrakes have given a smell, and in our gates are all sweet things, new and old: my well-beloved, I have kept _them_ for thee.
