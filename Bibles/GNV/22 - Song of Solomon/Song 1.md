###### 1 
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine. 

###### 2 
Because of the savor of thy good ointments, thy name _is as_ an ointment poured out: therefore the virgins love thee. 

###### 3 
Draw me: we will run after thee: the King hath brought me into his chambers: we will rejoice and be glad in thee: we will remember thy love more than wine: the righteous do love thee. 

###### 4 
I am black, O daughters of Jerusalem, but comely, as the tents of Kedar, _and_ as the curtains of Solomon. 

###### 5 
Regard ye me not because I am black: for the sun hath looked upon me. The sons of my mother were angry against me: they made me the keeper of the vines: but I kept not mine own vine. 

###### 6 
Show me, O _thou_ whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou liest at noon: for why should I be as she that turneth aside to the stocks of thy companions? 

###### 7 
If thou know not, O thou the fairest among women, get thee forth by the steps of the flock, and feed thy kids by the tents of the shepherds. 

###### 8 
I have compared thee, O my love, to the troupe of horses in the chariots of Pharaoh. 

###### 9 
Thy cheeks are comely with rows of stones, and thy neck with chains. 

###### 10 
We will make thee borders of gold with floods of silver. 

###### 11 
While the King was at his repast, my spikenard gave the smell thereof. 

###### 12 
My well-beloved _is as_ a bundle of myrrh unto me: he shall lie between my breasts. 

###### 13 
My well-beloved _is as_ a cluster of camphire unto me in the vines of En Gedi. 

###### 14 
My love, behold, thou art fair: behold, thou art fair: thine eyes _are like_ the doves. 

###### 15 
My well-beloved, behold, thou art fair, and pleasant: also our bed is green. 

###### 16 
The beams of our house _are_ cedars, our rafters _are_ of fir.
