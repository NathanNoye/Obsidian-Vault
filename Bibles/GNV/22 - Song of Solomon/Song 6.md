###### 1 
My well-beloved is gone down into his garden to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. 

###### 2 
I am my well-beloved's, and my well-beloved is mine, who feedeth among the lilies. 

###### 3 
Thou art beautiful, my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. 

###### 4 
Turn away thine eyes from me: for they overcome me: thine hair is like a flock of goats, which look down from Gilead. 

###### 5 
Thy teeth _are_ like a flock of sheep, which go up from the washing, which every one bring out twins, and none is barren among them. 

###### 6 
Thy temples _are_ within thy locks as a piece of a pomegranate. 

###### 7 
There are threescore Queens, and fourscore concubines, and of the damsels without number. 

###### 8 
_But_ my dove is alone, _and_ my undefiled, she is the only _daughter_ of her mother, and she is dear to her that bare her: the daughters have seen her, and counted her blessed: _even_ the Queens and the concubines, and they have praised her. 

###### 9 
Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, pure as the sun, terrible as an army with banners! 

###### 10 
I went down to the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine budded, _and if_ the pomegranates flourished. 

###### 11 
I knew nothing, my soul set me as the chariots of my noble people. 

###### 12 
Return, return, O Shulamite, return: return that we may behold thee. What shall you see in the Shulamite, _but_ as the company of an army?
