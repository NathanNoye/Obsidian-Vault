###### 1 
In my bed by night I sought him that my soul loved: I sought him, but I found him not. 

###### 2 
I will rise _therefore_ now, and go about in the city, by the streets, and by the open places, _and_ will seek him that my soul loveth: I sought him, but I found him not. 

###### 3 
The watchmen that went about the city, found me: _to whom I said_, Have you seen him whom my soul loveth? 

###### 4 
When I had passed a little from them, then I found him whom my soul loved: I took hold on him, and left him not, till I had brought him unto my mother's house, into the chamber of her that conceived me. 

###### 5 
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor waken _my_ love until she please. 

###### 6 
Who is she that cometh up out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke perfumed with myrrh and incense, _and_ with all the spices of the merchant? 

###### 7 
Behold his bed, which is Solomon's: threescore strong men _are_ round about it, of the valiant men of Israel. 

###### 8 
They all handle the sword, _and are_ expert in war, everyone _hath_ his sword upon his thigh for the fear by night. 

###### 9 
King Solomon made himself a palace of the trees of Lebanon. 

###### 10 
He made the pillars thereof of silver, _and_ the pavement thereof of gold, the hangings thereof of purple, whose midst _was_ paved with the love of the daughters of Jerusalem. 

###### 11 
Come forth, ye daughters of Zion, and behold the King Solomon with the crown, wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his marriage, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
