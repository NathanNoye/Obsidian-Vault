###### 1 
Behold, thou art fair, my love: behold, thou art fair: thine eyes _are like_ the doves: among thy locks thine hair is like the flock of goats, which look down from the mountain of Gilead. 

###### 2 
Thy teeth _are_ like a flock of _sheep _in good order, which go up from the washing: which every one brings out twins, and none is barren among them. 

###### 3 
Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy talk is comely: thy temples _are_ within thy locks as a piece of a pomegranate. 

###### 4 
Thy neck is as the tower of David built for defense: a thousand shields hang therein, _and_ all the targets of the strong men. 

###### 5 
Thy two breasts _are_ as two young roes that are twins, feeding among the lilies. 

###### 6 
Until the day break, and the shadows fly away, I will go into the mountain of myrrh, and to the mountain of incense. 

###### 7 
Thou art all fair my love, and there is no spot in thee. 

###### 8 
Come with me from Lebanon, _my_ spouse, _even_ with me from Lebanon, _and_ look from the top of Amana, from the top of Senir, and Hermon, from the dens of the lions, _and_ from the mountains of the leopards. 

###### 9 
My sister, _my_ spouse, thou hast wounded mine heart: thou hast wounded mine heart with one of thine eyes, _and_ with a chain of thy neck. 

###### 10 
My sister, _my_ Spouse, how fair is thy love? how much better is thy love than wine? and the savor of thine ointments than all spices? 

###### 11 
Thy lips, _my_ Spouse, drop _as_ honeycombs: honey and milk are under thy tongue, and the savor of thy garment _is_ as the savor of Lebanon. 

###### 12 
My sister, my spouse _is as_ a garden enclosed, as a spring shut up, _and_ a fountain sealed up. 

###### 13 
Thy plants _are as_ an orchard of pomegranates with sweet fruits, _as_ camphire, spikenard, 

###### 14 
_Even_ spikenard, and saffron: calamus, and cinnamon, with all the trees of incense, myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices. 

###### 15 
O fountain of the gardens, O well of living waters, and the springs of Lebanon. 

###### 16 
Arise, O North, and come, O South, _and_ blow on my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out: let my well-beloved come to his garden, and eat his pleasant fruit.
