###### 1 
Furthermore thou shalt make an Altar for sweet perfume, of Shittim wood thou shalt make it. 

###### 2 
The length thereof a cubit, and the breadth thereof a cubit, (it shall be foursquare) and the height thereof two cubits: the horns thereof _shall be_ of the same. 

###### 3 
And thou shalt overlay it with fine gold, _both_ the top thereof, and the sides thereof round about, and his horns: also thou shalt make unto it a crown of gold round about. 

###### 4 
Besides this thou shalt make under this crown two golden rings on either side: _even_ on every side shalt thou make _them_, that they may be as places for the bars to bear it withal. 

###### 5 
The which bars thou shalt make of Shittim wood, and shalt cover them with gold. 

###### 6 
After thou shalt set it before the veil, that is near the Ark of the Testimony, before the Mercy seat that is upon the Testimony, where I will appoint with thee. 

###### 7 
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning: when he dresseth the lamps thereof, shall he burn it. 

###### 8 
Likewise at even, when Aaron setteth up the lamps thereof, he shall burn incense: _this_ perfume _shall be_ perpetually before the Lord, throughout your generations. 

###### 9 
Ye shall offer no strange incense thereon, nor burnt sacrifice, nor offering, neither pour any drink offering thereon. 

###### 10 
And Aaron shall make reconciliation upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering _in the day_ of reconciliation: once in the year shall he make reconciliation upon it throughout your generations: this is most holy unto the Lord. 

###### 11 
¶ Afterward the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 12 
When thou takest the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then they shall give every man a redemption of his life unto the Lord, when thou tellest them, that there be no plague among them when thou countest them. 

###### 13 
This shall every man give, that goeth into the number, half a shekel, after the shekel of the Sanctuary: (a shekel _is_ twenty gerahs) the half shekel _shall be_ an offering to the Lord. 

###### 14 
All that are numbered from twenty years old and above, shall give an offering to the Lord. 

###### 15 
The rich shall not pass, and the poor shall not diminish from half a shekel, when ye shall give an offering unto the Lord, for the redemption of your lives. 

###### 16 
So thou shalt take the money of the redemption of the children of Israel, and shalt put it unto the use of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, that it may be a memorial unto the children of Israel before the Lord, for the redemption of your lives. 

###### 17 
¶ Also the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 18 
Thou shalt also make a Laver of brass, and his foot of brass to wash, and shalt put it between the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar, and shalt put water therein. 

###### 19 
For Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands, and their feet thereat. 

###### 20 
When they go into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, or when they go unto the Altar to minister, _and_ to make the perfume of the burnt offering to the Lord, they shall wash themselves with water, lest they die. 

###### 21 
So they shall wash their hands and their feet that they die not: and _this_ shall be to them an ordinance forever, _both_ unto him and to his seed throughout their generations. 

###### 22 
¶ Also the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 23 
Take thou also unto thee principal spices: of the most pure myrrh five hundred _shekels_, of sweet cinnamon half so much, _that is_, two hundred and fifty, and of sweet calamus, two hundred, and fifty: 

###### 24 
Also of Cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the Sanctuary, and of oil olive an Hin. 

###### 25 
So thou shalt make of it the oil of holy ointment, _even_ a most precious ointment after the art of the Apothecary: this shall be the oil of holy ointment. 

###### 26 
And thou shalt anoint the Tabernacle of the Congregation therewith, and the Ark of the Testimony: 

###### 27 
Also the Table, and all the instruments thereof, and the Candlestick, with all the instruments thereof, and the altar of incense: 

###### 28 
Also the altar of burnt offering with all his instruments, and the laver and his foot. 

###### 29 
So thou shalt sanctify them, and they shall be most holy: all that shall touch them, shall be holy. 

###### 30 
Thou shalt also anoint Aaron and his sons, and shalt consecrate them, that they may minister unto me in the Priest's office. 

###### 31 
Moreover thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, This shall be an holy anointing oil unto me, throughout your generations. 

###### 32 
None shall anoint man's flesh therewith, neither shall ye make any composition like unto it: _for_ it is holy, and shall be holy unto you. 

###### 33 
Whosoever shall make the like ointment, or whosoever shall put any of it upon a stranger, even he shall be cut off from his people. 

###### 34 
And the Lord said unto Moses, Take unto thee _these_ spices, pure myrrh and clear gum and galbanum, _these_ odors with pure frankincense of each like weight: 

###### 35 
Then thou shalt make of them perfume composed after the art of the apothecary, mingled together, pure _and_ holy. 

###### 36 
And thou shalt beat it to powder, and shalt put it before _the Ark_ of the Testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation, where I will make appointment with thee: it shall be unto you most holy. 

###### 37 
And ye shall not make unto you any composition like this perfume, which thou shalt make: it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord. 

###### 38 
Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto, even he shall be cut off from his people.
