###### 1 
This thing also shalt thou do unto them, when thou consecratest them to be my Priests, Take a young calf, and two rams without blemish, 

###### 2 
And unleavened bread, and cakes unleavened tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened anointed with oil: (of fine wheat flour shalt thou make them). 

###### 3 
Then thou shalt put them in one basket, and present them in the basket with the calf and the two rams, 

###### 4 
And shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and wash them with water. 

###### 5 
Also thou shalt take the garments, and put upon Aaron the tunicle, and the robe of the Ephod, and the Ephod, and the breastplate, and shalt close _them_ to him with the broidered girdle of the Ephod. 

###### 6 
Then thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and shalt put the holy crown upon the mitre. 

###### 7 
And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and shalt pour upon his head and anoint him. 

###### 8 
And thou shalt bring his sons, and put coats upon them. 

###### 9 
And shalt gird them with girdles, _both_ Aaron and his sons: and shalt put the bonnets on them, and the Priest's office shall be theirs for a perpetual law: thou shalt also fill the hands of Aaron, and the hands of his sons. 

###### 10 
After, thou shalt present the calf before the Tabernacle of the congregation, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the calf. 

###### 11 
So shalt thou kill the calf before the Lord, at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 12 
Then thou shalt take of the blood of the calf, and put it upon the horns of the Altar with thy finger, and shalt pour all _the rest_ of the blood at the foot of the Altar. 

###### 13 
Also thou shalt take all the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul, _that is_ on the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and shalt burn them upon the Altar. 

###### 14 
But the flesh of the calf, and his skin, and his dung shalt thou burn with fire without the host: it is a sin offering. 

###### 15 
¶ Thou shalt also take one ram, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 

###### 16 
Then thou shalt kill the ram, and take his blood, and sprinkle it round about upon the Altar, 

###### 17 
And thou shalt cut the ram in pieces, and wash the inwards of him and his legs, and shalt put them upon the pieces thereof, and upon his head. 

###### 18 
So thou shalt burn the whole ram upon the Altar: _for _it is a burnt offering unto the Lord for a sweet savor: it is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 

###### 19 
And shalt thou take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall put their hands upon the head of the ram. 

###### 20 
Then shalt thou kill the ram, and take of his blood, and put it upon the lap of Aaron's ear, and upon the lap of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. 

###### 21 
And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the Altar, and of the anointing oil, and shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him: so he shall be hallowed, and his clothes, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. 

###### 22 
Also thou shalt take of the rams the fat and the rump, even the fat that covereth the inwards, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder, (for it is the ram of consecration). 

###### 23 
And one loaf of bread, and one cake of bread _tempered_ with oil, and one wafer, out of the basket of the unleavened _bread_ that is before the Lord: 

###### 24 
And thou shalt put all this in the hands of Aaron, and in the hands of his sons, and shalt shake them to and fro before the Lord. 

###### 25 
Again, thou shalt receive them of their hands, and burn them upon the altar besides the burnt offering for a sweet savor before the Lord: _for _this is an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 

###### 26 
Likewise thou shalt take the breast of the ram of the consecration, which is for Aaron, and shalt shake it to and fro before the Lord, and it shall be thy part. 

###### 27 
And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the shaken offering, and the shoulder of the heave offering, which was shaken to and fro, and which was heaved up of the ram of the consecration which _was_ for Aaron, and which _was_ for his sons. 

###### 28 
And Aaron and his sons shall have it by a statute forever, of the children of Israel: for it is an heave offering, and it shall be an heave offering of the children of Israel, of their peace offerings, _even_ their heave offering to the Lord. 

###### 29 
¶ And the holy garments which _appertain_ to Aaron, shall be his sons' after him, to be anointed therein, and to be consecrated therein. 

###### 30 
That son that shall be Priest in his stead, shall put them on seven days, when he cometh into the Tabernacle of the Congregation to minister in the holy place. 

###### 31 
¶ So thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, and seethe his flesh in the holy place. 

###### 32 
And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 33 
So they shall eat these things, whereby their atonement was made, to consecrate them, _and_ to sanctify them: but a stranger shall not eat _thereof_, because they are holy things. 

###### 34 
Now if ought of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread remain unto the morning, then thou shalt burn the rest with fire: it shall not be eaten, because it is an holy thing. 

###### 35 
Therefore shalt thou do thus unto Aaron and unto his sons, according to all things which I have commanded thee: seven days shalt thou consecrate them. 

###### 36 
And shalt offer every day a calf for a sin offering, for reconciliation: and thou shalt cleanse the Altar, when thou hast offered upon it for reconciliation, and shalt anoint it to sanctify it. 

###### 37 
Seven days shalt thou cleanse the Altar and sanctify it, so the Altar shall be most holy: _and_ whatsoever toucheth the Altar, shall be holy. 

###### 38 
¶ Now this is that which thou shalt present upon the altar: _even_ two lambs of one year old, day by day continually. 

###### 39 
The one lamb thou shalt present in the morning, and the other lamb thou shalt present at even. 

###### 40 
And with the one lamb, a tenth part of fine flour mingled with the fourth part of an Hin of beaten oil, and the fourth part of an Hin of wine for a drink offering. 

###### 41 
And the other lamb thou shalt present at even: thou shalt do thereto according to the offering of the morning, and according to the drink offering thereof, _to be_ a burnt offering for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 42 
_This shall be_ a continually burnt offering in your generations at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord, where I will make appointment with you, to speak there unto thee. 

###### 43 
There I will appoint with the children of Israel, and _the place_ shall be sanctified by my glory. 

###### 44 
And I will sanctify the Tabernacle of the Congregation and the Altar: I will sanctify also Aaron and his sons to be my Priests, 

###### 45 
And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God. 

###### 46 
Then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them: I am the Lord their God.
