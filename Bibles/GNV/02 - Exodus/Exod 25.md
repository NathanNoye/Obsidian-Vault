###### 1 
Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel that they receive an offering for me: of every man, whose heart giveth it freely, ye shall take the offering for me. 

###### 3 
And this is the offering which ye shall take of them, gold and silver, and brass, 

###### 4 
And blue silk, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen and goat's _hair_, 

###### 5 
And ram's skins colored red, and the skins of badgers, and the wood Shittim, 

###### 6 
Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for the perfume of sweet savor. 

###### 7 
Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the Ephod, and in the breastplate. 

###### 8 
Also they shall make me a Sanctuary, that I may dwell among them. 

###### 9 
According to all that I show thee, even so shall ye make the form of the Tabernacle, and the fashion of all the instruments thereof. 

###### 10 
¶ They shall make also an Ark of Shittim wood, two cubits and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and a cubit and an half high. 

###### 11 
And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about. 

###### 12 
And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof: that is, two rings _shall be_ on the one side of it, and two rings on the other side thereof. 

###### 13 
And thou shalt make bars of Shittim wood, and cover them with gold. 

###### 14 
Then thou shalt put the bars in the rings by the sides of the Ark, to bear the Ark with them. 

###### 15 
The bars shall be in the rings of the Ark: they shall not be taken away from it. 

###### 16 
So thou shalt put in the Ark the Testimony, which I shall give thee. 

###### 17 
Also thou shalt make a Mercy seat of pure gold, two cubits and an half long and a cubit and an half broad. 

###### 18 
And thou shalt make two Cherubims of gold: of work beaten out with the hammer shalt thou make them at the two ends of the Mercy seat. 

###### 19 
And the one Cherub shalt thou make at the one end, and the other Cherub at the other end: of _the matter_ of the Mercy seat shall ye make the Cherubims, on the two ends thereof. 

###### 20 
And the Cherubims shall stretch their wings on high, covering the Mercy seat with their wings and their faces one to another: to the Mercy seatward shall the faces of the Cherubims be. 

###### 21 
And thou shalt put the Mercy seat above upon the Ark, and in the Ark thou shalt put the Testimony, which I will give thee. 

###### 22 
And there I will declare myself unto thee, and from above the Mercy seat between the two Cherubims, which are upon the Ark of the Testimony, I will tell thee all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. 

###### 23 
¶ Thou shalt also make a Table of Shittim wood, of two cubits long, and one cubit broad, and a cubit and a half high: 

###### 24 
And thou shalt cover it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about. 

###### 25 
Thou shalt also make unto it a border of four fingers round about: and thou shalt make a golden crown round about the border thereof: 

###### 26 
After, thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and shalt put the rings in the four corners that are in the four feet thereof. 

###### 27 
Over against the border shall the rings be for places for bars to bear the Table. 

###### 28 
And thou shalt make the bars of Shittim wood, and shalt overlay them with gold, that the Table may be borne with them. 

###### 29 
Thou shalt make also dishes for it, and _incense_ cups for it, and coverings for it, and goblets, wherewith it shall be covered, _even_ of fine gold shalt thou make them. 

###### 30 
And thou shalt set upon the Table Showbread before me continually. 

###### 31 
¶ Also thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of work beaten out with the hammer shall the Candlestick be made, his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops: and his flowers shall be of the same. 

###### 32 
Six branches also shall come out of the sides of it: three branches of the candlestick out of the one side of it, and three branches of the Candlestick out of the other side of it. 

###### 33 
Three bowls like unto almonds, one knop and _one_ flower in one branch: and three bowls like almonds in the _other_ branch, one knop and _one_ flower: so throughout the six branches that come out of the Candlestick. 

###### 34 
And in the _shaft_ of the Candlestick _shall be_ four bowls like unto almonds, his knops and his flowers. 

###### 35 
And _there shall be_ a knop under two branches _made_ thereof: and a knop under two branches _made_ thereof: and a knop under two branches _made_ thereof, according to the six branches coming out of the Candlestick. 

###### 36 
Their knops and their branches shall be thereof: all this shall be one beaten work of pure gold. 

###### 37 
And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and the lamps thereof shalt thou put thereon, to give light toward that that is before it. 

###### 38 
Also the snuffers and snuffdishes thereof _shall be_ of pure gold. 

###### 39 
Of a talent of fine gold shalt thou make it with all these instruments. 

###### 40 
Look therefore that thou make _them_ after their fashion, that was showed thee in the mountain.
