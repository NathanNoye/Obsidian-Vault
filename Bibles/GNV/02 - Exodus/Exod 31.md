###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, 

###### 3 
Whom I have filled with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all workmanship: 

###### 4 
To find out curious works to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, 

###### 5 
Also in the art to set stones, and to carve in timber, and to work in all manner of workmanship. 

###### 6 
And behold, I have joined him with Aholiab the son of Ahisamach of the tribe of Dan, and in the hearts of all that are wise hearted, have I put wisdom to make all that I have commanded thee: 

###### 7 
_That is_, the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and the Ark of the Testimony, and the Mercy seat that shall be thereupon, with all instruments of the Tabernacle: 

###### 8 
Also the Table and the instruments thereof, and the pure Candlestick with all his instruments, and the Altar of perfume: 

###### 9 
Likewise the Altar of burnt offering with all his instruments, and the Laver with his foot: 

###### 10 
Also the garments of the ministration, and the holy garment for Aaron the Priest, and the garments of his sons, to minister in the Priest's office, 

###### 11 
And the anointing oil, and sweet perfume for the Sanctuary according to all that I have commanded thee, shall they do. 

###### 12 
¶ Afterward the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 13 
Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, and say, Notwithstanding keep ye my Sabbaths: for it is a sign between me and you in your generations, that ye may know that I the Lord do sanctify you. 

###### 14 
Ye shall therefore keep the Sabbath: for it is holy unto you: he that defileth it, shall die the death: therefore whosoever worketh therein, the same person shall be even cut off from among his people. 

###### 15 
Six days shall men work, but in the seventh day is the Sabbath of the holy rest to the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the Sabbath day, shall die the death. 

###### 16 
Wherefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, that they may observe the rest throughout their generations for an everlasting Covenant. 

###### 17 
It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever: for in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, and in the seventh day he ceased and rested. 

###### 18 
Thus (when the Lord had made an end of communing with Moses upon mount Sinai) he gave him two Tables of the Testimony, _even_ tables of stone, written with the finger of God.
