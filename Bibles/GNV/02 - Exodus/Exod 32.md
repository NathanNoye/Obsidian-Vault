###### 1 
But when the people saw, that Moses tarried long ere he came down from the mountain, the people gathered themselves together against Aaron, and said unto him, Up, make us gods to go before us: for of this Moses (the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt) we know not what is become of him. 

###### 2 
And Aaron said unto them, Pluck off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 

###### 3 
Then all the people plucked from themselves the golden earrings, which were in their ears, and they brought _them_ unto Aaron. 

###### 4 
Who received them at their hands, and fashioned it with the graving tool, and made of it a molten calf: then they said, These be thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. 

###### 5 
When Aaron saw _that,_ he made an Altar before it: and Aaron proclaimed, saying, Tomorrow _shall be_ the holy day of the Lord. 

###### 6 
So they rose up the next day in the morning, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings: also the people sat them down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. 

###### 7 
¶ Then the Lord said unto Moses, Go get thee down: for thy people which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, hath corrupted _their ways_. 

###### 8 
They are soon turned out of the way, which I commanded them: _for_ they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have offered thereto, saying, These be thy gods, O Israel, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt. 

###### 9 
Again the Lord said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people. 

###### 10 
Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, for I will consume them: but I will make of thee a mighty people 

###### 11 
But Moses prayed unto the Lord his God, and said, O Lord, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought out of the land of Egypt, with great power and with a mighty hand? 

###### 12 
Wherefore shall the Egyptians speak, and say, He hath brought them out maliciously for to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the earth? turn from thy fierce wrath, and change thy mind from this evil toward thy people. 

###### 13 
Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidest unto them, I will multiply your seed, as the stars of heaven, and all this land, that I have spoken of, will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it forever. 

###### 14 
Then the Lord changed his mind from the evil, which he threatened to do unto his people. 

###### 15 
So Moses returned and went down from the mountain with the two Tables of the Testimony in his hand: the tables _were_ written on both their sides, even on the one side and on the other were they written. 

###### 16 
And these Tables were the work of God, and this writing was the writing of God graven in the Tables. 

###### 17 
And when Joshua heard the noise of the people, as they shouted, he said unto Moses, _There is_ a noise of war in the host. 

###### 18 
Who answered, It is not the noise of them that have the victory, nor the noise of them that are overcome: _but_ I do hear the noise of singing. 

###### 19 
Now, as soon as he came near unto the host, he saw the calf and the dancing: so Moses' wrath waxed hot, and he cast the Tables out of his hands, and brake them in pieces beneath the mountain. 

###### 20 
After, he took the calf, which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it unto powder, and strowed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. 

###### 21 
Also Moses said unto Aaron, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 

###### 22 
Then Aaron answered, Let not the wrath of my Lord wax fierce: Thou knowest this people, that they are _even set_ on mischief. 

###### 23 
And they said unto me, Make us gods to go before us: for we know not what is become of this Moses (the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt). 

###### 24 
Then I said to them, Ye that have gold, pluck it off: and they brought it me, and I did cast it into the fire, and _thereof_ came this calf. 

###### 25 
Moses therefore saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked unto _their_ shame among their enemies) 

###### 26 
And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who _pertaineth_ to the Lord? _let them come_ to me. And all the sons of Levi gathered themselves unto him. 

###### 27 
Then he said unto them, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel: Put every man his sword by his side, go to and fro, from gate to gate, through the host, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. 

###### 28 
So the children of Levi did as Moses had commanded: and there fell of the people the same day about three thousand men. 

###### 29 
(For Moses had said, Consecrate your hands unto the Lord this day, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother, that there may be given you a blessing this day.) 

###### 30 
And when the morning came, Moses said unto the people, Ye have committed a grievous crime: but now I will go up to the Lord, if I may pacify _him _for your sin. 

###### 31 
Moses therefore went again unto the Lord, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 

###### 32 
Therefore now if thou pardon their sin, _thy mercy shall appear_: but if thou wilt not, I pray thee, raise me out of thy book, which thou hast written. 

###### 33 
Then the Lord said to Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, I will put him out of my book. 

###### 34 
Go now therefore, bring the people unto the place which I commanded thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee, but yet in the day of my visitation I will visit their sin upon them. 

###### 35 
So the Lord plagued the people, because they caused Aaron _to make_ the calf which he made.
