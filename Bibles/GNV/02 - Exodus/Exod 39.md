###### 1 
Moreover they made garments of ministration to minister in the Sanctuary of blue silk, and purple, and scarlet: they made also the holy garments for Aaron, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 2 
So he made the Ephod of gold, blue silk, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 

###### 3 
And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires, to work it in the blue silk and in the purple, and in the scarlet, and in the fine linen, with broidered work. 

###### 4 
For the which they made shoulders to couple together: _for_ it was closed by the two edges thereof. 

###### 5 
And the broidered girdle of his Ephod that was upon him, was of the same stuff, and of like work: _even_ of gold, of blue silk, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 6 
¶ And they wrought _two_ Onyx stones closed in ouches of gold, and graved, as signets are graven, with the names of the children of Israel. 

###### 7 
And put them on the shoulders of the Ephod, _as_ stones for a remembrance of the children of Israel, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 8 
¶ Also he made the breastplate of broidered work like the work of the Ephod: to _wit_, of gold, blue silk, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen. 

###### 9 
They made the breast plate double, and it was square an hand breadth long, and an hand breadth broad: _it was also_ double. 

###### 10 
And they filled it with four rows of stones. The order _was thus,_ a Ruby, a Topaz, and a Carbuncle in the first row. 

###### 11 
And in the second row an Emerald, a Sapphire, and a Diamond: 

###### 12 
Also in the third row a Turquoise, an Agate, and an Hematite: 

###### 13 
Likewise in the fourth row a Chrysolite, an Onyx, and a Jasper: closed and set in ouches of gold. 

###### 14 
So the stones _were_ according to the names of the children of Israel, _even_ twelve after their names, graven like signets, every one after his name, according to the twelve tribes. 

###### 15 
After, they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of wreathen work _and_ pure gold. 

###### 16 
They made also two bosses of gold, and two gold rings, and put the two rings in the two corners of the breastplate. 

###### 17 
And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings, in the corners of the breastplate. 

###### 18 
Also the two _other_ ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in the two bosses, and put them on the shoulders of the Ephod, upon the forefront of it. 

###### 19 
Likewise they made two rings of gold, and put them in the two _other_ corners of the breastplate upon the edge of it, which was on the inside of the Ephod. 

###### 20 
They made also two _other_ golden rings, and put them on the two sides of the Ephod, beneath on the foreside of it, and over against his coupling above the broidered girdle of the Ephod. 

###### 21 
Then they fastened the breastplate by his rings unto the rings of the Ephod, with a lace of blue silk that it might be _fast_ upon the broidered girdle of the Ephod, and that the breastplate should not be loosed from the Ephod, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 22 
¶ Moreover, he made the robe of the Ephod of woven work, altogether of blue silk. 

###### 23 
And the hole of the robe _was_ in the midst of it, as the collar of an habergeon, with an edge about the collar, that it should not rent. 

###### 24 
And they made upon the skirt of the robe pomegranates, of blue silk and purple, and scarlet, and _fine linen_ twined. 

###### 25 
They made also bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates upon the skirts of the robe round about between the pomegranates. 

###### 26 
A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate round about the skirts of the robe to minister in, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 27 
¶ After, they made coats of fine linen, of woven work for Aaron and for his sons. 

###### 28 
And the mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen, and linen breeches of fine twined linen. 

###### 29 
¶ And the girdle of fine twined linen, and of blue silk, and purple, and scarlet, _even _of needle work, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 30 
¶ Finally, they made the plate for the holy crown of fine gold, and wrote upon it a superscription _like_ to the graving of a signet, HOLINESS TO THE LORD. 

###### 31 
And they tied unto it a lace of blue silk to fasten it on high upon the mitre, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 32 
¶ Thus was all the work of the Tabernacle, _even_ of the Tabernacle of the Congregation finished: and the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses: so did they. 

###### 33 
¶ Afterward they brought the Tabernacle unto Moses, the Tabernacle and all his instruments, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his pillars, and his sockets, 

###### 34 
And the covering of rams' skins, dyed red, and the coverings of badgers' skins, and the covering veil. 

###### 35 
The Ark of the testimony, and the bars thereof, and the Mercy seat. 

###### 36 
The Table, with all the instruments thereof, and the showbread. 

###### 37 
The pure Candlestick, the lamps thereof, _even_ the Lamps set in order, and all the instruments thereof, and the oil for light: 

###### 38 
Also the golden Altar and the anointing oil, and the sweet incense, and the hanging of the Tabernacle door, 

###### 39 
The brazen Altar with his grate of brass, his bars and all his instruments, the Laver and his foot. 

###### 40 
The curtains of the court with his pillars, and his sockets, and the hanging to the court gate, _and_ his cords, and his pins, and all the instruments of the service of the Tabernacle, _called_ the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 41 
_Finally_, the ministering garments to serve in the Sanctuary, _and_ the holy garments for Aaron the Priest, and his sons' garments to minister in the Priest's office. 

###### 42 
According to every point that the Lord had commanded Moses, so the children of Israel made all the work. 

###### 43 
And Moses beheld all the work, and behold they had done it as the Lord had commanded: so had they done: and Moses blessed them.
