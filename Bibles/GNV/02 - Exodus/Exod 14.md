###### 1 
Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak to the children of Israel, that they return and camp before Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the Sea, over against Baal Zephon: about it shall ye camp by the Sea. 

###### 3 
For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are tangled in the land: the wilderness hath shut them in. 

###### 4 
And I will harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall follow after you: so I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host: the Egyptians also shall know that I am the Lord: and they did so. 

###### 5 
¶ Then it was told the king of Egypt, that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we this done, and have let Israel go out of our service? 

###### 6 
And he made ready his chariots, and took his people with him, 

###### 7 
And took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. 

###### 8 
(For the Lord had hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he followed after the children of Israel: but the children of Israel went out with an high hand.) 

###### 9 
And the Egyptians pursued after them, and all the horses _and_ chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen and his host overtook them camping by the Sea, beside Pi Hahiroth, before Baal Zephon. 

###### 10 
And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lift up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them, and they were sore afraid: wherefore the children of Israel cried unto the Lord. 

###### 11 
And they said unto Moses, Hast thou brought us to die in the wilderness, because there were no graves in Egypt? wherefore hast thou served us thus, to carry us out of Egypt? 

###### 12 
Did not we tell thee this thing in Egypt, saying, Let us be in rest, that we may serve the Egyptians? for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. 

###### 13 
Then Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and behold the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you this day. For the Egyptians whom ye have seen this day, ye shall never see them again. 

###### 14 
The Lord shall fight for you: therefore hold you your peace. 

###### 15 
¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, Wherefore cryest thou unto me? speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward: 

###### 16 
And lift thou up thy rod, and stretch out thine hand upon the Sea and divide it, and let the children of Israel go on dry ground through the midst of the Sea. 

###### 17 
And I, behold, I will harden the heart of the Egyptians, that they may follow them, and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 

###### 18 
Then the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. 

###### 19 
(And the Angel of God, which went before the host of Israel, removed, and went behind them: also the pillar of the cloud went from before them, and stood behind them, 

###### 20 
And came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel: it was both a cloud and darkness, yet gave it light by night, so that all the night long the one came not at the other.) 

###### 21 
And Moses stretched forth his hand upon the Sea, and the Lord caused the Sea to run back by a strong East wind all the night, and made the Sea dry land: for the waters were divided. 

###### 22 
Then the children of Israel went through the midst of the Sea upon the dry ground, and the waters _were_ a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left hand. 

###### 23 
And the Egyptians pursued and went after them to the midst of the Sea, _even_ all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. 

###### 24 
Now, in the morning watch, when the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians, out of the fiery and cloudy pillar, he struck the host of the Egyptians with fear. 

###### 25 
For he took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them with much ado: so that the Egyptians _every_ one said, I will flee from the face of Israel: for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians. 

###### 26 
¶ Then the Lord said to Moses, Stretch thine hand upon the Sea, that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots and upon their horsemen. 

###### 27 
Then Moses stretched forth his hand upon the Sea, and the Sea returned to his force early in the morning, and the Egyptians fled against it: but the Lord overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the Sea. 

###### 28 
So the water returned and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, _even_ all the host of Pharaoh that came into the Sea after them: there remained not one of them. 

###### 29 
But the children of Israel walked upon dry land through the midst of the Sea, and the waters _were_ a wall unto them on their right hand, and on their left. 

###### 30 
Thus the Lord saved Israel the same day out of the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the Sea bank. 

###### 31 
And Israel saw the mighty power, which the Lord showed upon the Egyptians: so the people feared the Lord, and believed the Lord, and his servant Moses.
