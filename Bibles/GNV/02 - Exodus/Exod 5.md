###### 1 
Then afterward Moses and Aaron went and said to Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may celebrate a feast unto me in the wilderness. 

###### 2 
And Pharaoh said, Who is the Lord, that I should hear his voice, and let Israel go? I know not the Lord, neither will I let Israel go. 

###### 3 
And they said, We worship the God of the Hebrews: we pray thee, let us go three days' journey in the desert, and sacrifice unto the Lord our God, lest he bring upon us the pestilence or sword. 

###### 4 
Then said the King of Egypt unto them, Moses and Aaron, why cause ye the people to cease from their works? get you to your burdens. 

###### 5 
Pharaoh said furthermore, Behold, much people _is_ now in the land, and ye make them leave their burdens. 

###### 6 
Therefore Pharaoh gave commandment the same day unto the taskmasters of the people, and to their officers, saying, 

###### 7 
Ye shall give the people no more straw, to make brick (as in time past) _but_ let them go and gather them straw themselves. 

###### 8 
Notwithstanding lay upon them the number of brick, which they made in _time_ past, diminish nothing thereof: for they be idle, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go to offer sacrifice unto our God. 

###### 9 
Lay more work upon the men, and cause them to do it, and let them not regard vain words. 

###### 10 
¶ Then went the taskmasters of the people and their officers out, and told the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will give you no more straw. 

###### 11 
Go yourselves, get ye straw where ye can find it, yet shall nothing of your labor be diminished. 

###### 12 
Then were the people scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, for to gather stubble instead of straw. 

###### 13 
And the taskmasters hasted them, saying, Finish your day's work every day's task, as _ye did_ when ye had straw. 

###### 14 
And the Officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Wherefore have ye not fulfilled your [task] in making brick yesterday and today, as in times past? 

###### 15 
¶ Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore dealest thou thus thy servants? 

###### 16 
There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say unto us, Make brick: and lo, thy servants are beaten, and thy people is blamed. 

###### 17 
But he said, Ye are too much idle: therefore ye say, Let us go to offer sacrifice to the Lord. 

###### 18 
Go therefore now _and_ work: for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the whole tale of brick. 

###### 19 
Then the officers of the children of Israel saw themselves in an evil case, because it was said, Ye shall diminish nothing of your brick, _nor_ of every day's task. 

###### 20 
¶ And they met Moses and Aaron, which stood in their way as they came out from Pharaoh. 

###### 21 
To whom they said, The Lord look upon you and judge: for ye have made our savor to stink before Pharaoh and before his servants, in that ye have put a sword in their hand to slay us. 

###### 22 
Wherefore Moses returned to the Lord, and said, Lord, why hast thou afflicted this people? wherefore hast thou thus sent me? 

###### 23 
For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath vexed this people, and yet thou hast not delivered thy people.
