###### 1 
Then there went a man of the house of Levi, and took _to wife_ a daughter of Levi. 

###### 2 
And the woman conceived and bare a son: and when she saw that he was fair, she hid him three months. 

###### 3 
But when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark _made_ of reed, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and laid the child therein, and put _it_ among the bulrushes by the river's brink. 

###### 4 
Now his sister stood afar off, to wit what would come of him. 

###### 5 
¶ Then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash her in the river, and her maidens walked by the river's side: and when she saw the ark among the bulrushes, she sent her maid to fetch it. 

###### 6 
Then she opened it, and saw it was a child, and behold, the babe wept: so she had compassion on it, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. 

###### 7 
Then said his sister unto Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call unto thee a nurse of the Hebrew women to nurse thee the child? 

###### 8 
And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. So the maid went and called the child's mother. 

###### 9 
To whom Pharaoh's daughter said, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will reward thee. Then the woman took the child, and nursed him. 

###### 10 
Now the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaoh's daughter, and he was as her son, and she called his name Moses, because, said she, I drew him out of the water. 

###### 11 
¶ And in those days, when Moses was grown, he went forth unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens: also he saw an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew one of his brethren. 

###### 12 
And he looked round about, and when he saw no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. 

###### 13 
Again he came forth the second day, and behold two Hebrews strove: and he said unto him that did the wrong, Wherefore smitest thou thy fellow? 

###### 14 
And he answered, Who made thee a man of authority, and a judge over us? Thinkest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? Then Moses feared and said, Certainly this thing is known. 

###### 15 
Now Pharaoh heard this matter, and sought to slay Moses: therefore Moses fled from Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well. 

###### 16 
And the Priest of Midian had seven daughters, which came and drew _water_, and filled the troughs, for to water their father's sheep. 

###### 17 
Then the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses rose up, and defended them, and watered their sheep. 

###### 18 
And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How are ye come so soon today? 

###### 19 
And they said, A man of Egypt delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew us water enough, and watered the sheep. 

###### 20 
Then he said unto his daughters, And where is he? why have ye so left the man? call him that he may eat bread. 

###### 21 
And Moses agreed to dwell with the man: who gave unto Moses Zipporah his daughter: 

###### 22 
And she bare a son, whose name he called Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. 

###### 23 
¶ Then in process of time, the King of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed for the bondage and cried: and their cry for the bondage came up unto God. 

###### 24 
Then God heard their moan, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 

###### 25 
So God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect unto them.
