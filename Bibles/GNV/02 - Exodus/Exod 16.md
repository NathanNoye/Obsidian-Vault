###### 1 
Afterward all the Congregation of the children of Israel departed from Elim, and came to the wilderness of Sin, (which is between Elim and Sinai) the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of Egypt. 

###### 2 
And the whole Congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses, and against Aaron in the wilderness. 

###### 3 
For the children of Israel said to them, Oh that we had died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots, when we ate bread _our_ bellies full: for ye have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole company with famine. 

###### 4 
¶ Then said the Lord unto Moses, Behold, I will cause bread to rain from heaven to you, and the people shall go out, and gather that that is sufficient for every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law or no. 

###### 5 
But the sixth day they shall prepare that, which they shall bring _home_, and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 

###### 6 
Then Moses and Aaron said unto all the children of Israel, At even ye shall know, that the Lord brought you out of the land of Egypt: 

###### 7 
And in the morning ye shall see the glory of the Lord: for he hath heard your grudgings against the Lord: and what are we that ye have murmured against us? 

###### 8 
Again, Moses said, At even shall the Lord give you flesh to eat, and in the morning your fill of bread: for the Lord hath heard your murmurings, which ye murmur against him: for what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord. 

###### 9 
¶ And Moses said to Aaron, Say unto all the Congregation of the children of Israel, Draw near before the Lord: for he hath heard your murmurings. 

###### 10 
Now as Aaron spake unto the whole Congregation of the children of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud. 

###### 11 
(For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, saying, 

###### 12 
I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel: tell them _therefore_, and say, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread, and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.) 

###### 13 
And so at even the quails came and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 

###### 14 
And when the dew that was fallen was ascended, behold, a small round thing _was_ upon the face of the wilderness, small as the hoary frost upon the earth. 

###### 15 
And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is Manna, for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto them, This is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat. 

###### 16 
¶ This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded: gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for a man _according_ to the number of your persons: every man shall take for them which are in his tent. 

###### 17 
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 

###### 18 
And when they did measure it with an omer, he that had gathered much, had nothing over, and he that had gathered little, had no lack: _so_ every man gathered according to his eating. 

###### 19 
Moses then said unto them, Let no man reserve thereof till morning. 

###### 20 
Notwithstanding, they obeyed not Moses: but some of them reserved of it till morning, and it was full of worms, and stank: therefore Moses was angry with them. 

###### 21 
And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: for when the heat of the sun came, it was melted. 

###### 22 
¶ And the sixth day they gathered twice so much bread, two omers for one man: then all the rulers of the Congregation came and told Moses. 

###### 23 
And he answered them, This is that which the Lord hath said, Tomorrow _is_ the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord: bake that _today_ which ye will bake, and seethe that which ye will seethe, and all that remaineth, lay it up to be kept till the morning for you. 

###### 24 
And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses bade, and it stank not, neither was there any worm therein. 

###### 25 
Then Moses said, Eat that today: for today _is_ the Sabbath unto the Lord: today ye shall not find it in the field. 

###### 26 
Six days shall ye gather it, but in the seventh day _is_ the Sabbath: in it there shall be none. 

###### 27 
¶ Notwithstanding, there went out _some_ of the people in the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 

###### 28 
And the Lord said unto Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments, and my laws? 

###### 29 
Behold, how the Lord hath given you the Sabbath: therefore he giveth you the sixth day bread for two days: tarry _therefore_ every man in his place: let no man go out of his place the seventh day. 

###### 30 
So the people rested the seventh day. 

###### 31 
And the house of Israel called the name of it Manna, and it was like to coriander seed, _but_ white: and the taste of it was like unto wafers _made_ with honey. 

###### 32 
And Moses said, This is that which the Lord had commanded, Fill an omer of it, to keep it for your posterity: that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt. 

###### 33 
Moses also said to Aaron, Take a pot and put an omer full of Manna therein, and set it before the Lord to be kept for your posterity. 

###### 34 
As the Lord commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony to be kept. 

###### 35 
And the children of Israel did eat Manna forty years, until they came unto a land inhabited: they did eat Manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. 

###### 36 
The omer _is_ the tenth part of the Ephah.
