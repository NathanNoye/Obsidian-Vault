###### 1 
Then the Lord said unto Moses, Now shalt thou see, what I will do unto Pharaoh: for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and even be constrained to drive them out of his land. 

###### 2 
Moreover God spake unto Moses, and said unto him, I am the Lord, 

###### 3 
And I appeared unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob by _the_ Name of Almighty God, but by my Name Jehovah was I not known unto them. 

###### 4 
Furthermore as I made my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers: 

###### 5 
So I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and have remembered my covenant. 

###### 6 
Wherefore say thou unto the children of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from the burdens of the Egyptians, and will deliver you out of their bondage, and will redeem you in a stretched out arm, and in great judgments. 

###### 7 
Also I will take you for my people, and will be your God: then ye shall know that I the Lord your God bring you out from the burdens of the Egyptians. 

###### 8 
And I will bring you into the land which I sware that I would give to Abraham, and to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it unto you for a possession: I am the Lord.

###### 10 
Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 11 
Go speak to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that he let the children of Israel go out of his land. 

###### 12 
But Moses spake before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel hearken not unto me, how then shall Pharaoh hear me, which am of uncircumcised lips?

###### 25 
And Eleazar Aaron's son took him _one_ of the daughters of Putiel to his wife, which bare him Phinehas: these are the principal fathers of the Levites throughout their families. 

###### 26 
These are Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, Bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, according to their armies. 

###### 27 
These are that Moses, and Aaron, which spake to Pharaoh King of Egypt, that they might bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. 

###### 28

###### 29 
When the Lord, _I say_, spake unto Moses, saying, I am the Lord, speak thou unto Pharaoh the King of Egypt all that I say unto thee. 

###### 30 
Then Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips, and how shall Pharaoh hear me?
