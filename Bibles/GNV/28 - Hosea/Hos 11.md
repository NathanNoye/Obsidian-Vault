###### 1 
When Israel _was_ a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt. 

###### 2 
They called them, _but_ they went thus from them: they sacrificed unto Baal, and burnt incense to images. 

###### 3 
I led Ephraim also, _as one_ should bear them in his arms: but they knew not that I healed them. 

###### 4 
I led them with cords of a man, _even_ with bands of love, and I was to them, as he was taketh off the yoke from their jaws, and I laid the meat unto them. 

###### 5 
He shall no more return into the land of Egypt: but Assyria shall be his King, because they refused to convert. 

###### 6 
And the sword shall fall on his cities, and shall consume his bars, and devour them, because of their own counsels. 

###### 7 
And my people are bent to rebellion against me: though they called them to the most high, _yet_ none at all would exalt _him_. 

###### 8 
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? _how_ shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee, as Admah? _how_ shall I set thee, as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me: my repentings are rouled together. 

###### 9 
I will not execute the fierceness of my wrath: I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man, the holy one in the midst of thee, and I will not enter into the city. 

###### 10 
They shall walk after the Lord: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children of the West shall fear. 

###### 11 
They shall fear as a sparrow out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria, and I will place them in their houses, saith the Lord. 

###### 12 
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the Saints.
