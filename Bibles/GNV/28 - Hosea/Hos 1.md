###### 1 
The word of the Lord that came unto Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel. 

###### 2 
At the beginning the Lord spake by Hosea, and the Lord said unto Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of fornications, and children of fornications: for the land hath committed great whoredom, _departing_ from the Lord. 

###### 3 
So he went, and took Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, which conceived and bare him a son. 

###### 4 
And the Lord said unto him, Call his name Jezreel: for yet a little, and I will visit the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the house of Israel. 

###### 5 
And at that day will I also break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel. 

###### 6 
She conceived yet again, and bare a daughter, and _God_ said unto him, Call her name Lo-Ruhamah: for I will no more have pity upon the house of Israel: but I will utterly take them away. 

###### 7 
Yet I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save them by the Lord their God, and will not save them by bow, nor by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen. 

###### 8 
Now when she had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived, and bare a son. 

###### 9 
Then said _God_, Call his name Lo-Ammi: for ye are not my people: therefore will I not be yours. 

###### 10 
Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor told: and in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, it shall be said unto them, _Ye are_ the sons of the living God. 

###### 11 
Then shall the children of Judah, and the children of Israel be gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they shall come up out of the land: for great _is_ the day of Jezreel.
