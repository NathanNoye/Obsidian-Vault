###### 1 
Israel _is_ a empty vine, _yet_ hath it brought forth fruit unto itself, _and_ according to the multitude of the fruit thereof he hath increased the altars: according to the goodness of their land they have made fair images. 

###### 2 
Their heart is divided: now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars; he shall destroy their images. 

###### 3 
For now they shall say, We have no King because we feared not the Lord: and what should a King do to us? 

###### 4 
They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment groweth as wormwood in the furrows of the field. 

###### 5 
The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calf of Beth Aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the Chemarims thereof, that rejoiced on it for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it. 

###### 6 
It shall be also brought to Assyria, for a present unto king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel. 

###### 7 
Of Samaria, the king thereof is destroyed, as the foam upon the water. 

###### 8 
The high places also of Aven shall be destroyed, _even_ the sin of Israel: the thorn and the thistle shall grow upon their altars, and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us, and to the hills, Fall upon us. 

###### 9 
O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not touch them. 

###### 10 
It is my desire that I should chastise them, and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall gather themselves in their two furrows. 

###### 11 
And Ephraim _is as_ a heifer used to delight in threshing: but I will pass by her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride: Judah shall plow, _and_ Jacob shall break his clods. 

###### 12 
Sow to yourselves in righteousness: reap after the measure of mercy: break up your fallow ground: for _it is_ time to seek the Lord, till he come and rain righteousness upon you. 

###### 13 
_But_ you have plowed wickedness: ye have reaped iniquity: you have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thine own ways, _and_ in the multitude of thy strong men, 

###### 14 
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy munitions shall be destroyed, as Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in the day of battle: the mother with the children was dashed in pieces. 

###### 15 
So shall Bethel do unto you, because of your malicious wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel be destroyed.
