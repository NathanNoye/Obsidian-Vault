###### 1 
Then said the Lord to me, Go yet, _and_ love a woman (beloved of _her_ husband, and was an harlot) according to the love of the Lord toward the children of Israel: yet they looked to other gods, and loved the wine bottles. 

###### 2 
So I bought her to me for fifteen _pieces_ of silver, and for an homer of barley, and an half _homer_ of barley. 

###### 3 
And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide with me many days: thou shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt be to none _other_ man, and I will be so unto thee. 

###### 4 
For the children of Israel shall remain many days without a king and without a prince, and without an offering, and without an image, and without an Ephod, and without Teraphim. 

###### 5 
Afterward shall the children of Israel convert and seek the Lord their God, and David their king, and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.
