###### 1 
Set the trumpet to thy mouth: _he shall come_ as an eagle against the House of the Lord, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my Law. 

###### 2 
Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee. 

###### 3 
Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him. 

###### 4 
They have set up a king, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols: therefore shall they be destroyed. 

###### 5 
Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off: mine anger is kindled against them: how long will they be without innocency! 

###### 6 
For it came even from Israel: the workman made it, therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be _broken_ in pieces. 

###### 7 
For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall bring forth no meal: if so be it brought forth, the strangers shall devour it. 

###### 8 
Israel is devoured, now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein _is_ no pleasure. 

###### 9 
For they are gone up to Assyria: _they are as_ a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers. 

###### 10 
Yet though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king _and_ the princes. 

###### 11 
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, his altars _shall be_ to sin. 

###### 12 
I have written to them the great things of my Law: but they were counted as a strange thing. 

###### 13 
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it: _but_ the Lord accepteth them not: now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt. 

###### 14 
For Israel hath forgotten his maker, and buildeth Temples, and Judah hath increased strong cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
