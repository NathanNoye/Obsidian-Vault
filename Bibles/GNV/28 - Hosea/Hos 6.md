###### 1 
Come, and let us return to the Lord: for he hath spoiled, and he will heal us: he hath wounded us, and he will bind us up. 

###### 2 
After two days will he revive us, _and_ in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight. 

###### 3 
Then shall we have knowledge, and endeavor ourselves to know the Lord: his going forth is prepared as the morning, and he shall come unto us as the rain, _and_ as the latter rain unto the earth. 

###### 4 
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, how shall I entreat thee? for your goodness _is_ as a morning cloud, and as the morning dew it goeth away. 

###### 5 
Therefore have I cut down by the Prophets: I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and thy judgments _were as_ the light that goeth forth. 

###### 6 
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings. 

###### 7 
But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they trespassed against me. 

###### 8 
Gilead _is_ a city of them that work iniquity, _and is_ polluted with blood. 

###### 9 
And as the thieves wait for a man, _so_ the company of Priests murder in the way by consent: for they work mischief. 

###### 10 
I have seen villainy in the house of Israel: there _is_ the whoredom of Ephraim: Israel is defiled. 

###### 11 
Yea, Judah hath set a plant for thee, while I would return the captivity of my people.
