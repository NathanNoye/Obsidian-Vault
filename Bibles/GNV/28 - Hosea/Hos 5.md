###### 1 
O ye Priests, hear this, and hearken ye, O house of Israel, and give ye ear, O house of the King: for judgment is toward you, because you have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor. 

###### 2 
Yet they were profound to decline to slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all. 

###### 3 
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou art become an harlot, _and_ Israel is defiled. 

###### 4 
They will not give their minds to turn unto their God: for the spirit of fornication is in the midst of them, and they have not known the Lord. 

###### 5 
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them. 

###### 6 
They shall go with their sheep, and with their bullocks, to seek the Lord: but they shall not find him: _for_ he hath withdrawn himself from them. 

###### 7 
They have transgressed against the Lord: for they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their portions. 

###### 8 
Blow ye the trumpet in Gibeah, _and_ the shame in Ramah: cry out at Beth Aven, after thee, O Benjamin. 

###### 9 
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the tribes of Israel have I caused to know the truth. 

###### 10 
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: _therefore_ will I pour out my wrath upon them like water. 

###### 11 
Ephraim is oppressed _and_ broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment. 

###### 12 
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as a rottenness. 

###### 13 
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah his wound, then went Ephraim unto Assyria, and sent unto King Jareb: yet could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound. 

###### 14 
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a lion's whelp, to the house of Judah: I, _even_ I will spoil and go away: I will take away, and none shall rescue it. 

###### 15 
I will go, _and_ return to my place, till they acknowledge their fault, and seek me: in their affliction, they will seek me diligently.
