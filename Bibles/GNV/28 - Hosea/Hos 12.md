###### 1 
Ephraim is fed with the wind, and followeth after the East wind: he increaseth daily lies and destruction, and they do make a covenant with Assyria, and oil is carried into Egypt. 

###### 2 
The Lord hath also a controversy with Judah, and will visit Jacob, according to his ways: according to his works, will he recompense him. 

###### 3 
He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God, 

###### 4 
And had power over the Angel, and prevailed: he wept and prayed unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us. 

###### 5 
Yea, the Lord God of hosts, the Lord _is_ himself his memorial. 

###### 6 
Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and hope still in thy God. 

###### 7 
_He is_ Canaan: the balances of decree _are_ in his hand: he loveth to oppress. 

###### 8 
And Ephraim said, Notwithstanding I am rich, I have found me out riches in all my labors: they shall find none iniquity in me, that were wickedness. 

###### 9 
Though I am the Lord thy God, from the land of Egypt, yet will I make thee to dwell in the tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast. 

###### 10 
I have also spoken by the Prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes by the ministry of the Prophets. 

###### 11 
Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal, and their altars _are_ as heaps in the furrows of the field. 

###### 12 
And Jacob fled into the country of Aram, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept _sheep,_ 

###### 13 
And by a Prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a Prophet was he reserved. 

###### 14 
_But_ Ephraim provoked him with high places: therefore shall his blood be poured upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord reward him.
