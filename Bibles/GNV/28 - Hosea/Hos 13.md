###### 1 
When Ephraim spake, there _was_ trembling: he exalted himself in Israel, but he hath sinned in Baal, and is dead. 

###### 2 
And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten images of their silver, _and_ idols according to their own understanding: they were all the work of the craftsmen: they say one to another while they sacrifice a man, Let them kiss the calves. 

###### 3 
Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the morning dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with a whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke that goeth out of the chimney. 

###### 4 
Yet I am the Lord thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou shalt know no God but me: for there is no Savior beside me. 

###### 5 
I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of drought. 

###### 6 
As in their pastures, so were they filled: they were filled, and their heart was exalted: therefore have they forgotten me. 

###### 7 
And I will be unto them as a very lion, _and_ as a leopard in the way of Assyria. 

###### 8 
I will meet them, as a bear that is robbed of her whelps, and I will break the caul of their heart, and there will I devour them like a lion: the wild beasts shall tear them. 

###### 9 
O Israel, one hath destroyed thee, but in me _is_ thine help. 

###### 10 
I am: where is thy king that should help thee in all thy cities? and thy judges, of whom thou saidest, Give me a king and princes? 

###### 11 
I gave thee a king in mine anger, and I took him away in my wrath. 

###### 12 
The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up: his sin _is_ hid. 

###### 13 
The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is an unwise son, else would he not stand still at the time, _even_ at the breaking forth of the children. 

###### 14 
I will redeem them from the power of the grave: I will deliver them from death: O death, I will be thy death: O grave, I will be thy destruction: repentance is hid from mine eyes. 

###### 15 
Though he grew up among _his_ brethren, an East wind shall come, _even_ the wind of the Lord shall come up from the wilderness, and dry up his vein, and his fountain shall be dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.
