###### 1 
Rejoice not, O Israel for joy as_ other_ people: for thou hast gone a whoring from thy God: thou hast loved a reward upon every corn floor. 

###### 2 
The floor, and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her. 

###### 3 
They will not dwell in the Lord's land, but Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean things in Assyria. 

###### 4 
They shall not offer wine to the Lord, neither shall their sacrifices be pleasant unto him: _but they shall be_ unto them as the bread of mourners: all that eat thereof, shall be polluted: for their bread for their souls shall not come into the house of the Lord. 

###### 5 
What will ye do then in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the Lord? 

###### 6 
For lo, they are gone from destruction: _but_ Egypt shall gather them up, and Memphis shall bury them: the nettle shall possess the pleasant _places_ of their silver, _and_ the thorn _shall be_ in their tabernacles. 

###### 7 
The days of visitation are come: the days of recompense are come: Israel shall know it: the Prophet _is_ a fool: the spiritual man _is_ mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity: therefore the hatred is great. 

###### 8 
The watchman of Ephraim _should be_ with my God: _but_ the Prophet _is_ the snare of a fowler in all his ways, _and_ hatred in the house of his God. 

###### 9 
They are deeply set: they are corrupt as in the days of Gibeah: _therefore_ he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins. 

###### 10 
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness: I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the fig tree at her first time: _but_ they went to Baal Peor, and separated themselves unto that shame, and _their_ abominations were according to their lovers. 

###### 11 
Ephraim their glory shall flee away like a bird: from the birth and from the womb, and from the conception. 

###### 12 
Though they bring up their children, yet I will deprive them from being men: yea, woe to them, when I depart from them. 

###### 13 
Ephraim, as I saw, _is as a tree_ in Tyre planted in a cottage: but Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer. 

###### 14 
O Lord, give them: what wilt thou give them? give them a barren womb and dry breasts. 

###### 15 
All their wickedness _is_ in Gilgal: for there do I hate them: for the wickedness of their inventions, I will cast them out of mine House: I will love them no more: all their princes are rebels. 

###### 16 
Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up: they can bring no fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the dearest of their body. 

###### 17 
My God will cast them away, because they did not obey him: and they shall wander among the nations.
