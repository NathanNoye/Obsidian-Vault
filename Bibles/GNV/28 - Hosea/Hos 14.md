###### 1 
Samaria shall be desolate: for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped. 

###### 2 
O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God: for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity. 

###### 3 
Take unto you words, and turn to the Lord, and say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive _us_ graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips. 

###### 4 
Assyria shall not save us, neither will we ride upon horses, neither will we say anymore to the work of our hands, _Ye are_ our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy. 

###### 5 
I will heal their rebellion: I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him. 

###### 6 
I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily and fasten his roots, as _the trees_ of Lebanon. 

###### 7 
His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon. 

###### 8 
They that dwell under his shadow, shall return: they shall revive _as_ the corn, and flourish as the vine: the scent thereof _shall be_ as the wine of Lebanon. 

###### 9 
Ephraim _shall say_, What have I to do anymore with idols? I have heard him, and looked upon him: I am like a green fir tree: upon me is thy fruit found. 

###### 10 
Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? and prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the Lord _are_ righteous and the just shall walk in them: but the wicked shall fall therein.
