###### 1 
When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they have dealt falsely: and the thief cometh in, and the robber spoileth without. 

###### 2 
And they consider not in their hearts, _that_ I remember all their wickedness: now their own inventions have beset them about: they are in my sight. 

###### 3 
They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies. 

###### 4 
They are all adulterers, _and_ as a very oven heated by the baker, which ceaseth from raising up, _and_ from kneading the dough until it be leavened. 

###### 5 
_This is_ the day of our king: the princes have made him sick with flagons of wine: he stretcheth out his hand to scorners. 

###### 6 
For they have made ready their heart like an oven while they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night: in the morning it burneth as a flame of fire. 

###### 7 
They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges: all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me. 

###### 8 
Ephraim hath mixed himself among the people. Ephraim is as a cake on the hearth not turned. 

###### 9 
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here, and there upon him, yet he knoweth not. 

###### 10 
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face, and they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek him for all this. 

###### 11 
Ephraim also is like a dove deceived without heart: they call to Egypt: they go to Assyria. 

###### 12 
_But_ when they shall go, I will spread my net upon them, _and_ draw them down as the fowls of the heaven: I will chastise them as their Congregation hath heard. 

###### 13 
Woe unto them: for they have fled away from me: destruction _shall be_ unto them, because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me. 

###### 14 
And they have not cried unto me with their hearts, when they howled upon their beds: they assembled themselves for corn, and wine, _and_ they rebel against me. 

###### 15 
Though I have bound _and_ strengthened their arm, yet do they imagine mischief against me. 

###### 16 
They return, _but_ not to the most high: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, for the rage of their tongues: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.
