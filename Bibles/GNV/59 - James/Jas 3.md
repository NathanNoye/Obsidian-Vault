###### 1 
My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation. 

###### 2 
For in many things we sin all. If any man sin not in word, he is a perfect man, and able to bridle all the body. 

###### 3 
Behold, we put bits into the horses' mouths, that they should obey us, and we turn about all their body. 

###### 4 
Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small rudder, whithersoever the governor listeth. 

###### 5 
Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth of great things: behold, how great a thing a little fire kindleth. 

###### 6 
And the tongue is fire, _yea_, a world of wickedness: so is the tongue set among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature, and it is set on fire of hell. 

###### 7 
For the whole nature of beasts, and of birds, and of creeping things, and things of the sea is tamed, and hath been tamed of the nature of man. 

###### 8 
But the tongue can no man tame. _It is_ an unruly evil, full of deadly poison. 

###### 9 
Therewith bless we God even the Father, and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God. 

###### 10 
Out of one mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing: my brethren, these things ought not so to be. 

###### 11 
Doth a fountain send forth at one place sweet _water_ and bitter? 

###### 12 
Can the fig tree, my brethren, bring forth olives, either a vine figs? so can no fountain make both salt water and sweet. 

###### 13 
Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him show by good conversation his works in meekness of wisdom. 

###### 14 
But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, rejoice not, neither be liars against the truth. 

###### 15 
This wisdom descendeth not from above, but _is_ earthly, sensual, and devilish. 

###### 16 
For where envying and strife _is_, there _is_ sedition, and all manner of evil works. 

###### 17 
But the wisdom that _is_ from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, easy to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, and without hypocrisy. 

###### 18 
And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace, of them that make peace.
