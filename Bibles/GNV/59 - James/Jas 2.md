###### 1 
My brethren, have not the faith of our glorious Lord Jesus Christ in respect of persons. 

###### 2 
For if there come into your company a man with a gold ring, and in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment, 

###### 3 
And ye have a respect to him that weareth the gay clothing; and say unto him, Sit thou here in a goodly place, and say unto the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool, 

###### 4 
Are ye not partial in your selves, and are become Judges of evil thoughts? 

###### 5 
Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God chosen the poor of this world, _that they should be _rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he promised to them that love him? 

###### 6 
But ye have despised the poor. Do not the rich oppress you by tyranny, and do they not draw you before the judgment seats? 

###### 7 
Do not they blaspheme the worthy Name after which ye be named? 

###### 8 
But if ye fulfill the royal Law according to the Scripture, _which saith_, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself, ye do well. 

###### 9 
But if ye regard the persons, ye commit sin, and are rebuked of the Law, as transgressors. 

###### 10 
For whosoever shall keep the whole Law, _and_ yet faileth in one _point_, he is guilty of all. 

###### 11 
For he that said, Thou shalt not commit adultery, said also, Thou shalt not kill. Now though thou doest none adultery, yet if thou killest, thou art a transgressor of the Law. 

###### 12 
So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judgeth by the Law of liberty. 

###### 13 
For there shall be condemnation merciless to him that showeth not mercy, and mercy rejoiceth against condemnation. 

###### 14 
What availeth it my brethren, though a man saith, he hath faith, when he hath no works? can that faith save him? 

###### 15 
For if a brother or a sister be naked and destitute of daily food, 

###### 16 
And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace: warm yourselves, and fill your bellies, notwithstanding ye give them not those things, which are needful to the body, what helpeth it? 

###### 17 
Even so the faith, if it have no works, is dead in itself. 

###### 18 
But some man might say, Thou hast the faith, and I have works: show me thy faith out of thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works. 

###### 19 
Thou believest that there is one God: thou doest well: the devils also believe it, and tremble. 

###### 20 
But wilt thou understand, O thou vain man, that the faith _which is_ without works, is dead? 

###### 21 
Was not Abraham our father justified through works, when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar? 

###### 22 
Seest thou not that the faith wrought with his works? and through the works was the faith made perfect. 

###### 23 
And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the friend of God. 

###### 24 
Ye see then how that of works a man is justified, and not of faith only. 

###### 25 
Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified through works, when she had received the messengers, and sent them out another way? 

###### 26 
For as the body without the spirit is dead, even so the faith without works is dead.
