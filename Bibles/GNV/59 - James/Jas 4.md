###### 1 
From whence _are_ wars and contentions among you? are they not hence, _even_ of your pleasures, that fight in your members? 

###### 2 
Ye lust, and have not: ye envy, and desire immoderately, and cannot obtain: ye fight, and war, and get nothing, because ye ask not. 

###### 3 
Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye might lay the same on your pleasures. 

###### 4 
Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the amity of the world is the enmity of God? Whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world, maketh himself the enemy of God. 

###### 5 
Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us, lusteth after envy? 

###### 6 
But _the Scripture_ offereth more grace, _and_ therefore saith, God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 

###### 7 
Submit yourselves to God: resist the devil, and he will flee from you. 

###### 8 
Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners, and purge your hearts, ye double minded. 

###### 9 
Suffer afflictions, and sorrow ye, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning, and _your_ joy into heaviness. 

###### 10 
Cast down yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. 

###### 11 
Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, or he that condemneth his brother, speaketh evil of the Law, and condemneth the Law: and if thou condemnest the Law, thou art not an observer of the Law, but a judge. 

###### 12 
There is one Lawgiver, which is able to save, and to destroy, Who art thou that judgest another man? 

###### 13 
Go to now, ye that say, Today or tomorrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain, 

###### 14 
(And yet ye cannot tell what _shall be_ tomorrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapor that appeareth for a little time, and afterward vanisheth away.) 

###### 15 
For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, and if we live, we will do this or that. 

###### 16 
But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil. 

###### 17 
Therefore to him that knoweth how to do well, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
