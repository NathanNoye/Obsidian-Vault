###### 1 
James a servant of God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve Tribes, which are scattered abroad, salutation. 

###### 2 
My brethren, count it exceeding joy, when ye fall into divers tentations, 

###### 3 
Knowing that the trying of your faith bringeth forth patience, 

###### 4 
And let patience have _her_ perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, lacking nothing. 

###### 5 
If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, which giveth to all men liberally, and reproacheth no man, and it shall be given him. 

###### 6 
But let him ask in faith, and waver not: for he that wavereth, is like a wave of the sea, tossed of the wind, and carried away. 

###### 7 
Neither let that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. 

###### 8 
A double minded man _is_ unstable in all his ways. 

###### 9 
Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted: 

###### 10 
Again, he that is rich, in that he is made low: for as the flower of the grass, shall he vanish away. 

###### 11 
For _as when_ the sun riseth with heat, then the grass withereth, and his flower falleth away, and the goodly shape of it perisheth: even so shall the rich man wither away in _all_ his ways. 

###### 12 
Blessed _is_ the man, that endureth tentation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him. 

###### 13 
Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. 

###### 14 
But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away by his own concupiscence, and is enticed. 

###### 15 
Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin, and sin when it is finished, bringeth forth death. 

###### 16 
Err not my dear brethren. 

###### 17 
Every good giving and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning. 

###### 18 
Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be as the firstfruits of his creatures. 

###### 19 
Wherefore my dear brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, _and_ slow to wrath. 

###### 20 
For the wrath of man doth not accomplish the righteousness of God. 

###### 21 
Wherefore lay apart all filthiness, and superfluity of maliciousness, _and_ receive with meekness the word that is grafted in you, which is able to save your souls. 

###### 22 
And be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves. 

###### 23 
For if any hear the word, and do it not, he is like unto a man, that beholdeth his natural face in a glass. 

###### 24 
For when he hath considered himself, he goeth his way, and forgetteth immediately what manner of one he was. 

###### 25 
But who so looketh in the perfect law of liberty, and continueth _therein_, he not being a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, shall be blessed in his deed. 

###### 26 
If any man among you seem religious, and refraineth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion _is_ vain. 

###### 27 
Pure religion and undefiled before God, even the Father, is this, to visit the fatherless, and widows in their adversity, _and_ to keep himself unspotted of the world.
