###### 1 
Better is a dry morsel, if peace _be_ with it, than an house full of sacrifices _with_ strife. 

###### 2 
A discrete servant shall have rule over a lewd son, and he shall divide the heritage among the brethren. 

###### 3 
_As is_ the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold, so the Lord trieth the hearts. 

###### 4 
The wicked giveth heed to false lips, _and_ a liar hearkeneth to the naughty tongue. 

###### 5 
He that mocketh the poor, reproacheth him that made him: and he that rejoiceth at destruction, shall not be unpunished. 

###### 6 
Children's children are the crown of the elders: and the glory of the children _are_ their fathers. 

###### 7 
High talk becometh not a fool, much less a lying talk a prince. 

###### 8 
A reward _is as_ a stone pleasant in the eyes of them that have it: it prospereth, whithersoever it turneth. 

###### 9 
He that covereth a transgression, seeketh love: but he that repeateth a matter, separateth the prince. 

###### 10 
A reproof entereth more into him that hath understanding, than an hundred stripes into a fool. 

###### 11 
A seditious person seeketh only evil, and a cruel messenger shall be sent against him. 

###### 12 
_It is better_ for a man to meet a bear robbed of her whelps, than a fool in his folly. 

###### 13 
He that rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house. 

###### 14 
The beginning of strife _is as_ one that openeth the waters: therefore, or the contention be meddled with, leave off. 

###### 15 
He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord. 

###### 16 
Wherefore is there a price in the hand of the fool to get wisdom, and _he hath_ none heart? 

###### 17 
A friend loveth at all times; and a brother is born for adversity. 

###### 18 
A man destitute of understanding, toucheth the hand, and becometh surety for his neighbor. 

###### 19 
He loveth transgression that loveth strife: _and_ he that exalteth his gate, seeketh destruction. 

###### 20 
The froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a naughty tongue, shall fall into evil. 

###### 21 
He that begetteth a fool, _getteth_ himself sorrow, and the father of a fool can have no joy. 

###### 22 
A joyful heart causeth good health: but a sorrowful mind drieth the bones. 

###### 23 
A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to wrest the ways of judgment. 

###### 24 
Wisdom _is_ in the face of him that hath understanding: but the eyes of a fool _are_ in the corners of the world. 

###### 25 
A foolish son is a grief unto his father, and a heaviness to her that bare him. 

###### 26 
Surely it is not good to condemn the just, nor that the princes should smite _such_ for equity. 

###### 27 
He that hath knowledge, spareth his words, and a man of understanding _is_ of an excellent spirit. 

###### 28 
Even a fool, (when he holdeth his peace) is counted wise, and he that stoppeth his lips, prudent.
