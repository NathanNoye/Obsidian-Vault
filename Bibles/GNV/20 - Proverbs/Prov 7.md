###### 1 
My son keep my words, and hide my commandments with thee. 

###### 2 
Keep my commandments, and thou shalt live, and mine instruction, as the apple of thine eyes. 

###### 3 
Bind them upon thy fingers, _and_ write them upon the table of thine heart. 

###### 4 
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister, and call understanding _thy_ kinswoman, 

###### 5 
That they may keep thee from the strange woman, _even_ from the strange that is smooth in her words. 

###### 6 
¶ As _I was_ in the window of mine house, I looked through my window, 

###### 7 
And I saw among the fools, _and_ considered among the children a young man destitute of understanding, 

###### 8 
Who passed through the street by her corner, and went toward her house, 

###### 9 
In the twilight in the evening, when the night began to be black and dark. 

###### 10 
And behold, there met him a woman with an harlot's behavior, and subtle in heart. 

###### 11 
(She is babbling and loud, whose feet cannot abide in her house. 

###### 12 
Now _she is_ without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner) 

###### 13 
So she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him, 

###### 14 
I have peace offerings: this day have I paid my vows. 

###### 15 
Therefore came I forth to meet thee, that I might seek thy face: and I have found thee. 

###### 16 
I have decked my bed with ornaments, carpets and laces of Egypt. 

###### 17 
I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 

###### 18 
Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us take our pleasure in dalliance. 

###### 19 
For _mine_ husband is not at home: he is gone a journey far off. 

###### 20 
He hath taken with him a bag of silver, _and_ will come home at the day appointed. 

###### 21 
Thus with her great craft she caused him to yield, and with her flattering lips she enticed him. 

###### 22 
And he followed her straightway, as an ox that goeth to the slaughter, and as a fool to the stocks for correction, 

###### 23 
Till a dart strike through his liver, as a bird hasteth to the snare, not knowing that he is in danger. 

###### 24 
¶ Hear me now therefore, O children, and hearken to the words of my mouth. 

###### 25 
Let not thine heart decline to her ways: wander thou not in her paths. 

###### 26 
For she hath caused many to fall down wounded, _and_ the strong men _are_ all slain by her. 

###### 27 
Her house is the way unto the grave, which goeth down to the chambers of death.
