###### 1 
Hear, O ye children, the instruction of a father, and give ear to learn understanding. 

###### 2 
For I do give you a good doctrine: _therefore_ forsake ye not my law. 

###### 3 
For I was my father's son, tender and dear in the sight of my mother, 

###### 4 
When he taught me, and said unto me, Let thine heart hold fast my words: keep my commandments, and thou shalt live. 

###### 5 
Get wisdom: get understanding: forget not, neither decline from the words of my mouth. 

###### 6 
Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee: love her and she shall preserve thee. 

###### 7 
Wisdom _is_ the beginning: get wisdom _therefore_: and above all thy possession get understanding. 

###### 8 
Exalt her, and she shall exalt thee: she shall bring thee to honor, if thou embrace her. 

###### 9 
She shall give a comely ornament unto thine head, _yea_, she shall give thee a crown of glory. 

###### 10 
¶ Hear, my son: and receive my words, and the years of thy life shall be many. 

###### 11 
I have taught thee in the way of wisdom, _and_ led thee in the paths of righteousness. 

###### 12 
When thou goest, thy gait shall not be strait, and when thou runnest, thou shalt not fall. 

###### 13 
Take hold of instruction, _and_ leave not: keep her, for she is thy life. 

###### 14 
¶ Enter not into the way of the wicked, and walk not in the way of evil men. 

###### 15 
Avoid it, _and_ go not by it: turn from it, and pass by. 

###### 16 
For they cannot sleep, except they have done evil, and their sleep departeth except they cause _some_ to fall. 

###### 17 
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence. 

###### 18 
But the way of the righteous shineth as the light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day. 

###### 19 
The way of the wicked _is_ as the darkness: they know not wherein they shall fall. 

###### 20 
¶ My son, hearken unto my words, incline thine ear unto my sayings. 

###### 21 
Let them not depart from thine eyes, _but_ keep them in the midst of thine heart. 

###### 22 
For they are life unto those that find them: and health unto all their flesh. 

###### 23 
Keep thine heart with all diligence: for thereout cometh life. 

###### 24 
Put away from thee a froward mouth, and put wicked lips far from thee. 

###### 25 
Let thine eyes behold the right, and let thine eyelids direct thy way before thee. 

###### 26 
Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be ordered aright. 

###### 27 
Turn not to the right hand, nor to the left, _but_ remove thy foot from evil.
