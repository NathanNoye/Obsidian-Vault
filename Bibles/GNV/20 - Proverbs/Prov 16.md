###### 3 
Commit thy works unto the Lord, and thy thoughts shall be directed. 

###### 4 
The Lord hath made all things for his own sake: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil. 

###### 5 
All that are proud in heart, _are_ an abomination to the Lord: _though_ hand _join_ in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

###### 14 
The wrath of a king _is as_ messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it. 

###### 15 
In the light of the king's countenance _is _life: and his favor _is_ as a cloud of the latter rain. 

###### 16 
How much better is it to get wisdom than gold? and to get understanding, is more to be desired than silver. 

###### 17 
The path of the righteous is to decline from evil, and he keepeth his soul that keepeth his way. 

###### 18 
Pride _goeth_ before destruction, and an high mind before the fall. 

###### 19 
Better it is to be of humble mind with the lowly, than to divide the spoils with the proud. 

###### 20 
He that is wise in _his_ business, shall find good: and he that trusteth in the Lord, he is blessed. 

###### 21 
The wise in heart shall be called prudent and the sweetness of the lips shall increase doctrine. 

###### 22 
Understanding _is_ a wellspring of life unto them that have it: and the instruction of fools _is_ folly. 

###### 23 
The heart of the wise guideth his mouth wisely, and addeth doctrine to his lips. 

###### 24 
Fair words _are as_ an honey comb, sweetness to the soul, and health to the bones. 

###### 25 
There is a way that seemeth right unto man, but the issue thereof _are_ the ways of death. 

###### 26 
The person that travaileth, travaileth for himself: for his mouth craveth it of him. 

###### 27 
A wicked man diggeth up evil, and in his lips _is_ like burning fire. 

###### 28 
A froward person soweth strife: and a taleteller maketh division among princes. 

###### 29 
A wicked man deceiveth his neighbor, and leadeth him into the way that is not good. 

###### 30 
He shutteth his eyes to devise wickedness: he moveth his lips, _and_ bringeth evil to pass. 

###### 31 
Age is a crown of glory, _when_ it is found in the way of righteousness. 

###### 32 
He that is slow unto anger, is better than the mighty man: and he that ruleth his own mind, _is better_ than he that winneth a city. 

###### 33 
The lot is cast into the lap: but the whole disposition thereof _is_ of the Lord.
