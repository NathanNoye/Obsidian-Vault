###### 1 
My son, forget not thou my Law, but let thine heart keep my commandments. 

###### 2 
For they shall increase the length of thy days and the years of life, and _thy_ prosperity. 

###### 3 
Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them on thy neck, _and_ write them upon the table of thine heart. 

###### 4 
So shalt thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of God and man. 

###### 5 
¶ Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own wisdom. 

###### 6 
In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy ways. 

###### 7 
¶ Be not wise in thine own eyes: _but_ fear the Lord, and depart from evil. 

###### 8 
_So_ health shall be unto thy navel, and marrow unto thy bones. 

###### 9 
Honor the Lord with thy riches, and with the first _fruits_ of all thine increase. 

###### 10 
So shall thy barns be filled with abundance, and thy presses shall burst with new wine. 

###### 11 
¶ My son, refuse not the chastening of the Lord, neither be grieved with his correction. 

###### 12 
For the Lord correcteth him, whom he loveth, even as the father _doth_ the child, in _whom_ he delighteth. 

###### 13 
Blessed _is_ the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding. 

###### 14 
For the merchandise thereof is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof _is better_ than gold. 

###### 15 
It is more precious than pearls: and all things that thou canst desire, are not to be compared unto her. 

###### 16 
Length of days _is_ in her right hand, _and_ in her right hand riches and glory. 

###### 17 
Her ways _are_ ways of pleasure, and all her paths prosperity. 

###### 18 
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold on her, and blessed is he that retaineth her. 

###### 19 
The Lord by wisdom hath laid the foundation of the earth, and hath stablished the heavens through understanding. 

###### 20 
By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew. 

###### 21 
My son, let not _these things_ depart from thine eyes, _but_ observe wisdom and counsel. 

###### 22 
So they shall be life to thy soul, and grace unto thy neck. 

###### 23 
Then shalt thou walk safely by the way: and thy foot shall not stumble. 

###### 24 
If thou sleepest, thou shalt not be afraid: and when thou sleepest, thy sleep shall be sweet. 

###### 25 
Thou shalt not fear for _any_ sudden fear, neither for destruction of the wicked, when it cometh. 

###### 26 
For the Lord shall be for thine assurance, and shall preserve thy foot from taking. 

###### 27 
¶ Withhold not the good from the owners thereof, though there be power in n hand to do it. 

###### 28 
Say not unto thy neighbor, Go and come again, and tomorrow will I give _thee_, if thou _now_ have it. 

###### 29 
¶ Intend none hurt against thy neighbor, seeing he doth dwell without fear by thee. 

###### 30 
¶ Strive not with a man causeless, when he hath done thee no harm. 

###### 31 
¶ Be not envious for the wicked man, neither choose any of his ways, 

###### 32 
For the froward _is_ abomination unto the Lord: but his secret _is_ with the righteous. 

###### 33 
The curse of the Lord is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous. 

###### 34 
With the scornful he scorneth, but he giveth grace unto the humble. 

###### 35 
The wise shall inherit glory: but fools dishonor, _though_ they be exalted.
