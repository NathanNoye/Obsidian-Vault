###### 1 
The prophecy _which_ the man spake unto Ithiel, _even_ to Ithiel, and Ucal. 

###### 2 
Surely I am more foolish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man in me. 

###### 3 
For I have not learned wisdom, nor attained to the knowledge of holy things. 

###### 4 
Who hath ascended up to heaven, and descended? Who hath gathered the wind in his fist? Who hath bound the waters in a garment? Who hath established all the ends of the world? What is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell? 

###### 5 
Every word of God is pure: he is a shield to those that trust in him. 

###### 6 
Put nothing unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar. 

###### 7 
Two things have I required of thee: deny me them not before I die. 

###### 8 
Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me not poverty, nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me, 

###### 9 
Lest I be full, and deny _thee_, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor and steal, and take the Name of my God _in vain_. 

###### 10 
Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, when thou hast offended. 

###### 11 
_There is_ a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother. 

###### 12 
_There is_ a generation that are pure in their own conceit, and _yet_ are not washed from their filthiness. 

###### 13 
_There is_ a generation whose eyes are haughty, and their eye lids are lifted up. 

###### 14 
_There is_ a generation, whose teeth _are as_ swords, and their chaws _as_ knives to eat up the afflicted out of the earth, and the poor from among men. 

###### 15 
The horseleech hath two daughters _which cry_, Give, give. There be three things that will not be satisfied: _yea_, four that say not, It is enough. 

###### 16 
The grave, and the barren womb, the earth, that cannot be satisfied with water, and the fire that saith not, It is enough. 

###### 17 
The eye that mocketh _his_ father and despiseth the instruction of _his_ mother, let the ravens of the valley pick it out, and the young eagles eat it. 

###### 18 
There be three things hid from me: yea, four that I know not: 

###### 19 
The way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon a stone, the way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid. 

###### 20 
Such is the way also of an adulterous woman: she eateth and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have not committed iniquity. 

###### 21 
For three things the earth is moved: yea, for four it cannot sustain itself. 

###### 22 
For a servant when he reigneth, and a fool when he is filled with meat, 

###### 23 
For the hateful woman, when she is married, and for a handmaid that is heir to her mistress. 

###### 24 
These be four small things in the earth, yet they are wise, and full of wisdom. 

###### 25 
The pismires a people not strong, yet prepare they their meat in summer: 

###### 26 
The conies a people not mighty, yet make they their houses in the rock: 

###### 27 
The grasshopper hath no king, yet go they forth all by bands: 

###### 28 
The spider taketh hold with _her_ hands, and is in king's palaces. 

###### 29 
There be three things that order well _their_ going: yea, four are comely in going: 

###### 30 
A lion which is strong among beasts, and turneth not at the sight of any: 

###### 31 
A lusty greyhound, and a goat, and a king against whom there is no rising up. 

###### 32 
If thou hast been foolish in lifting thyself up, and if thou hast thought wickedly, _lay_ thine hand upon _thy_ mouth. 

###### 33 
When one churneth milk, he bringeth forth butter: and he that wringeth his nose, causeth blood to come out, so he that forceth wrath, bringeth forth strife.
