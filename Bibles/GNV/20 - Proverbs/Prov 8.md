###### 1 
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding utter her voice? 

###### 2 
She standeth in the top of the high places, by the way in the place of the paths. 

###### 3 
She crieth besides the gates before the city at the entry of the doors, 

###### 4 
O men, I call unto you, and _utter_ my voice to the children of men. 

###### 5 
O _ye_ foolish men, understand wisdom, and _ye_, O fools, be wise in heart. 

###### 6 
Give ear, for I will speak of excellent things, and the opening of my lips _shall teach_ things that be right. 

###### 7 
For my mouth shall speak the truth, and my lips abhor wickedness. 

###### 8 
All the words of my mouth _are_ righteous: there is no lewdness, nor frowardness in them. 

###### 9 
They are all plain to them that will understand, and straight to them that would find knowledge. 

###### 10 
Receive mine instruction, and not silver, and knowledge rather than fine gold. 

###### 11 
For wisdom is better than precious stones: and all pleasures are not to be compared unto her. 

###### 12 
I wisdom dwell with prudence, and I find forth knowledge _and_ counsels. 

###### 13 
The fear of the Lord _is_ to hate evil, _as_ pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way: and a mouth _that speaketh_ lewd things I do hate. 

###### 14 
I have counsel and wisdom: I am understanding, _and_ I have strength. 

###### 15 
By me kings reign, and princes decree justice. 

###### 16 
By me princes rule, and the nobles, _and_ all the judges of the earth. 

###### 17 
I love them that love me: and they that seek me early shall find me. 

###### 18 
Riches and honor _are_ with me: _even_ durable riches and righteousness. 

###### 19 
My fruit is better than gold, _even_ than fine gold, and my revenues _better_ than fine silver. 

###### 20 
I cause to walk in the way of righteousness, _and_ in the midst of the paths of judgment, 

###### 21 
That I may cause them that love me, to inherit substance, and I will fill their treasures. 

###### 22 
The Lord hath possessed me in the beginning of his way: _I was_ before his works of old. 

###### 23 
I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, _and_ before the earth. 

###### 24 
When there were no depths, was I begotten, when there were no fountains abounding with water. 

###### 25 
Before the mountains were settled: _and_ before the hills, was I begotten. 

###### 26 
He had not yet made the earth, nor the open places, nor the height of the dust in the world. 

###### 27 
When he prepared the heavens, I was there, when he set the compass upon the deep: 

###### 28 
When he established the clouds above: when he confirmed the fountains of the deep: 

###### 29 
When he gave his decree to the sea, that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the foundations of the earth. 

###### 30 
Then was I with him _as_ a nourisher, and I was daily _his_ delight, rejoicing always before him, 

###### 31 
And took my solace in the compass of his earth: and my delight _is_ with the children of men. 

###### 32 
Therefore now hearken, O children, unto me: for blessed _are they that_ keep my ways. 

###### 33 
Hear instruction, and be ye wise, and refuse it not: blessed _is_ the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, _and_ giving attendance at the posts of my doors. 

###### 34 
For he that findeth me, findeth life, and shall obtain favor of the Lord. 

###### 35 
But he that sinneth against me, hurteth his own soul: _and_ all that hate me, love death.
