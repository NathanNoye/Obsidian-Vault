###### 1 
THE WORDS OF KING LEMUEL: The prophecy which his mother taught him. 

###### 2 
What my son! and what the son of my womb! and what, O son of my desires! 

###### 3 
Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways _which is_ to destroy kings. 

###### 4 
It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes strong drink, 

###### 5 
Lest he drink and forget the decree, and change the judgment of all the children of affliction. 

###### 6 
Give ye strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto them that have grief of heart. 

###### 7 
Let him drink, that he may forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more. 

###### 8 
Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all the children of destruction. 

###### 9 
Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and judge the afflicted, and the poor. 

###### 10 
¶ Who shall find a virtuous woman? for her price _is_ far above the pearls. 

###### 11 
The heart of her husband trusteth in her, and he shall have no need of spoil. 

###### 12 
She will do him good, and not evil all the days of her life. 

###### 13 
She seeketh wool and flax, and laboreth cheerfully with her hands. 

###### 14 
She is like the ships of merchants: she bringeth her food from afar. 

###### 15 
And she ariseth, while it is yet night: and giveth the portion to her household, and the ordinary to her maids. 

###### 16 
She considereth a field, and getteth it: _and_ with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. 

###### 17 
She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms. 

###### 18 
She feeleth that her merchandise is good: her candle is not put out by night. 

###### 19 
She putteth her hands to the wheel, and her hands handle the spindle. 

###### 20 
She stretcheth out her hand to the poor, and putteth forth her hands to the needy. 

###### 21 
She feareth not the snow for her family: for all her family is clothed with scarlet. 

###### 22 
She maketh herself carpets: fine linen and purple _is_ her garment. 

###### 23 
Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth with the Elders of the land. 

###### 24 
She maketh sheets, and selleth them, and giveth girdles unto the merchant. 

###### 25 
Strength and honor _is_ her clothing, and in the latter day she shall rejoice. 

###### 26 
She openeth her mouth with wisdom, and the law of grace _is_ in her tongue. 

###### 27 
She overseeth the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. 

###### 28 
Her children rise up, and call her blessed: her husband also shall praise her, _saying_, 

###### 29 
Many daughters have done virtuously: but thou surmountest them all. 

###### 30 
Favor _is_ deceitful, and beauty _is_ vanity: _but_ a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised. 

###### 31 
Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her own works praise her in the gates.
