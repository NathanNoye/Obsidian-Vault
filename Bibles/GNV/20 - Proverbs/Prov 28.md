###### 1 
The wicked flee when none pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion. 

###### 2 
For the transgression of the land _there are_ many princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge _a realm_ likewise endureth long. 

###### 3 
A poor man, if he oppress the poor, is like a raging rain that _leaveth_ no food. 

###### 4 
They that forsake the Law, praise the wicked: but they that keep the Law, set themselves against them. 

###### 5 
Wicked men understand not judgment: but they that seek the Lord, understand all things. 

###### 6 
Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that perverteth _his_ ways, though he be rich. 

###### 7 
He that keepeth the Law, is a child of understanding: but he that feedeth the gluttons, shameth his father. 

###### 8 
He that increaseth his riches by usury and interest, gathereth them for him that will be merciful unto the poor. 

###### 9 
He that turneth away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer shall be abominable. 

###### 10 
He that causeth the righteous to go astray by an evil way, shall fall into his own pit, and the upright shall inherit good things. 

###### 11 
The rich man is wise in his own conceit: but the poor that hath understanding, can try him. 

###### 12 
When righteous men rejoice, _there is_ great glory: but when the wicked come up, the man is tried. 

###### 13 
He that hideth his sins, shall not prosper: but he that confesseth, and forsaketh _them_, shall have mercy. 

###### 14 
Blessed _is_ the man that feareth always: but he that hardeneth his heart, shall fall into evil. 

###### 15 
_As_ a roaring lion, and an hungry bear, _so is_ a wicked ruler over the poor people. 

###### 16 
A prince destitute of understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness, shall prolong _his_ days. 

###### 17 
A man that doeth violence against the blood of a person, shall flee unto the grave, _and_ they shall not stay him. 

###### 18 
He that walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is froward in _his_ ways, shall once fall. 

###### 19 
He that tilleth his land, shall be satisfied with bread, but he that followeth the idle, shall be filled with poverty. 

###### 20 
A faithful man shall abound in blessings, and he that maketh haste to be rich, shall not be innocent. 

###### 21 
To have respect of persons is not good: for _that_ man will transgress for a piece of bread. 

###### 22 
A man with a wicked eye hasteth to riches, and knoweth not that poverty shall come upon him. 

###### 23 
He that rebuketh a man, shall find more favor at the length, than he that flattereth with _his_ tongue. 

###### 24 
He that robbeth his father and mother, and saith, It is no transgression, is the companion of a man that destroyeth. 

###### 25 
He that is of a proud heart, stirreth up strife: but he that trusteth in the Lord, shall be fat. 

###### 26 
He that trusteth in his own heart, is a fool: but he that walketh in wisdom, shall be delivered. 

###### 27 
He that giveth unto the poor, shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes, _shall have_ many curses. 

###### 28 
When the wicked rise up, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
