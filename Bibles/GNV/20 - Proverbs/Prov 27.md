###### 1 
Boast not thyself of tomorrow, for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth. 

###### 2 
Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth: a stranger, and not thine own lips. 

###### 3 
A stone _is_ heavy, and the sand weighty: but a fool's wrath _is_ heavier than them both. 

###### 4 
Anger is cruel, and wrath _is_ raging: but who can stand before envy? 

###### 5 
Open rebuke _is_ better than secret love. 

###### 6 
The wounds of a lover _are_ faithful, and the kisses of an enemy _are_ pleasant. 

###### 7 
The person that is full, despiseth an honeycomb: but unto the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet. 

###### 8 
As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his own place. 

###### 9 
_As_ ointment and perfume rejoice the heart, so _doth_ the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel. 

###### 10 
Thine own friend and thy father's friend forsake thou not: neither enter into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: _for_ better is a neighbor _that is_ near, than a brother far off. 

###### 11 
My son, be wise, and rejoice mine heart, that I may answer him that reproacheth me. 

###### 12 
A prudent man seeth the plague, and hideth himself: _but_ the foolish go on still, _and_ are punished. 

###### 13 
Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and a pledge of him for the stranger. 

###### 14 
He that praiseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted to him as a curse. 

###### 15 
A continual dropping in the day of rain, and a contentious woman are alike. 

###### 16 
He that hideth her, hideth the wind, and _she is as_ the oil in his right hand that uttereth itself. 

###### 17 
Iron sharpeneth iron, so doth man sharpen the face of his friend. 

###### 18 
He that keepeth the fig tree, shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth upon his master, shall come to honor. 

###### 19 
As in water face _answereth_ to face, so the heart of man to man. 

###### 20 
The grave and destruction can never be full, so the eyes of man can never be satisfied. 

###### 21 
_As is_ the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold, so_ is_ every man according to his dignity. 

###### 22 
Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat brayed with a pestle, _yet_ will not his foolishness depart from him. 

###### 23 
Be diligent to know the state of thy flock, and take heed to the herds. 

###### 24 
For riches _remain_ not always, nor the crown from generation to generation. 

###### 25 
The hay discovereth itself, and the grass appeareth, and the herbs of the mountains are gathered. 

###### 26 
The lambs _are_ for thy clothing, and the goats _are_ the price of the field. 

###### 27 
And let the milk of the goats _be_ sufficient for thy food, for the food of thy family, and for the sustenance of thy maids.
