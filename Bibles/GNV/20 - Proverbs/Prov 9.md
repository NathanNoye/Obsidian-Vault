###### 1 
Wisdom hath built her house, _and_ hewn out her seven pillars. 

###### 2 
She hath killed her victuals, drawn her wine, and prepared her table. 

###### 3 
She hath sent forth her maidens, _and_ crieth upon the highest places of the city, _saying_, 

###### 4 
Who so is simple, let him come hither, _and_ to him that is destitute of wisdom, she saith, 

###### 5 
Come, _and_ eat of my meat, and drink of the wine _that_ I have drawn. 

###### 6 
Forsake _your way_, ye foolish, and ye shall live: and walk in the way of understanding. 

###### 7 
He that reproveth a scorner, purchaseth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh the wicked, _getteth_ himself a blot. 

###### 8 
Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate thee: _but_ rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. 

###### 9 
Give _admonition_ to the wise, and he will be the wiser: teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. 

###### 10 
The beginning of wisdom _is_ the fear of the Lord, and the knowledge of holy things, _is_ understanding. 

###### 11 
For thy days shall be multiplied by me, and the years of thy life shall be augmented. 

###### 12 
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself, _and if_ thou be a scorner, thou alone shalt suffer. 

###### 13 
¶ A foolish woman _is_ troublesome; she _is_ ignorant and knoweth nothing. 

###### 14 
But she sitteth at the door of her house on a seat in the high places of the city, 

###### 15 
To call them that pass by the way, that go right on their way, _saying_, 

###### 16 
Who so is simple let him come hither, and to him that is destitute of wisdom, she saith also, 

###### 17 
Stolen waters are sweet, and hid bread is pleasant. 

###### 18 
But he knoweth not, that the dead _are_ there, _and that_ her guests _are_ in the depth of hell.
