###### 1 
For the desire _thereof_ he will separate himself to seek it, _and_ occupy himself in all wisdom. 

###### 2 
A fool hath no delight in understanding: but that his heart may be discovered. 

###### 3 
When the wicked cometh, then cometh contempt, and with the vile man reproach. 

###### 4 
The words of a man's mouth _are like_ deep waters, _and_ the wellspring of wisdom _is like_ a flowing river. 

###### 5 
It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to cause the righteous to fall in judgment. 

###### 6 
A fool's lips come with strife, and his mouth calleth for stripes. 

###### 7 
A fool's mouth _is_ his own destruction, and his lips _are_ a snare for his soul. 

###### 8 
The words of a talebearer _are_ as flatterings, and they go down into the bowels of the belly. 

###### 9 
He also that is slothful in his work, is even the brother of him that is a great waster. 

###### 10 
The name of the Lord _is_ a strong tower: the righteous runneth unto it, and is exalted. 

###### 11 
The rich man's riches _are_ his strong city: and as an high wall in his imagination. 

###### 12 
Before destruction the heart of a man is haughty, and before glory _goeth_ lowliness. 

###### 13 
He that answereth a matter before he hear it, it is folly and shame unto him. 

###### 14 
The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity: but a wounded spirit, who can bear it? 

###### 15 
A wise heart getteth knowledge, and the ear of the wise seeketh learning. 

###### 16 
A man's gift enlargeth him, and leadeth him before great men. 

###### 17 
_He that is_ first in his own cause, _is_ just: then cometh his neighbor and maketh inquiry of him. 

###### 18 
The lot causeth contentions to cease, and maketh a partition among the mighty. 

###### 19 
A brother offended _is harder to win_ than a strong city, and _their_ contentions _are_ like the bar of a palace. 

###### 20 
With the fruit of a man's mouth shall his belly be satisfied, _and_ with the increase of his lips shall he be filled. 

###### 21 
Death and life _are_ in the power of the tongue, and they that love it, shall eat the fruit thereof. 

###### 22 
He that findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and receiveth favor of the Lord. 

###### 23 
The poor speaketh _with_ prayers: but the rich answereth roughly. 

###### 24 
A man _that hath_ friends, _ought_ to show himself friendly: for a friend is nearer than a brother.
