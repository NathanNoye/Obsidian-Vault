###### 1 
My son, hearken unto my wisdom, _and_ incline thine ear unto my knowledge, 

###### 2 
That thou mayest regard counsel, and thy lips observe knowledge. 

###### 3 
For the lips of a strange woman drop _as_ an honeycomb, and her mouth is more soft than oil. 

###### 4 
But the end of her is bitter as wormwood, _and_ sharp as a two-edged sword. 

###### 5 
Her feet go down to death, and her steps take hold on hell. 

###### 6 
She weigheth not the way of life: her paths are moveable: thou canst not know _them_. 

###### 7 
Hear ye me now therefore, O children, and depart not from the words of my mouth. 

###### 8 
Keep thy way far from her, and come not near the door of her house, 

###### 9 
Lest thou give thine honor unto others, and thy years to the cruel: 

###### 10 
Lest the stranger should be filled with thy strength, and thy labors be in the house of a stranger, 

###### 11 
And thou mourn at thine end, (when thou hast consumed thy flesh and thy body) 

###### 12 
And say, How have I hated instruction, and mine heart despised correction! 

###### 13 
And have not obeyed the voice of them that taught me, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me! 

###### 14 
I was almost _brought_ into all evil in the midst of the Congregation and assembly. 

###### 15 
¶ Drink the water of thy cistern, and of the rivers out of the midst of thine own well. 

###### 16 
Let thy fountains flow forth, and the rivers of waters in the streets. 

###### 17 
But let them be thine, _even_ thine only, and not the strangers with thee. 

###### 18 
Let thy fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of thy youth. 

###### 19 
_Let her be as_ the loving hind and pleasant roe: let her breasts satisfy thee at all times, _and_ delight in her love continually. 

###### 20 
For why shouldest thou delight, my son, in a strange woman, or embrace the bosom of a stranger? 

###### 21 
For the ways of man _are_ before the eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his paths. 

###### 22 
His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his own sin. 

###### 23 
He shall die for fault of instruction, and shall go astray through his great folly.
