###### 1 
The King's heart _is_ in the hand of the Lord, _as_ the rivers of waters: he turneth it whithersoever it pleaseth him. 

###### 2 
Every way of a man _is_ right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the hearts. 

###### 3 
To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice. 

###### 4 
A haughty look, and a proud heart _which is_ the light of the wicked, _is_ sin. 

###### 5 
The thoughts of the diligent _do_ surely _bring_ abundance; but whosoever is hasty, _cometh_ surely to poverty. 

###### 6 
The gathering of treasures by a deceitful tongue, _is_ vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death. 

###### 7 
The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; for they have refused to execute judgment. 

###### 8 
The way of some _is_ perverted and strange, but of the pure man, his work _is_ right. 

###### 9 
It is better to dwell in a corner of the house top, than with a contentious woman in a wide house. 

###### 10 
The soul of the wicked wisheth evil, _and_ his neighbor hath no favor in his eyes. 

###### 11 
When the scorner is punished, the foolish is wise, and when one instructeth the wise, he will receive knowledge. 

###### 12 
The righteous teacheth the house of the wicked; _but God_ overthroweth the wicked for _their_ evil. 

###### 13 
He that stoppeth his ear at the crying of the poor, he shall also cry and not be heard. 

###### 14 
A gift in secret pacifieth anger, and a gift in the bosom, great wrath. 

###### 15 
It is joy to the just to do judgment; but destruction _shall be_ to the workers of iniquity. 

###### 16 
A man that wandereth out of the way of wisdom, shall remain in the congregation of the dead. 

###### 17 
He that loveth pastime, _shall be_ a poor man; _and_ he that loveth wine and oil, shall not be rich. 

###### 18 
The wicked _shall be_ a ransom for the just, and the transgressor for the righteous. 

###### 19 
It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and angry woman. 

###### 20 
In the house of the wise is a pleasant treasure and oil; but a foolish man devoureth it. 

###### 21 
He that followeth after righteousness and mercy, shall find life, righteousness and glory. 

###### 22 
A wise man goeth up into the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof. 

###### 23 
He that keepeth his mouth and his tongue, keepeth his soul from afflictions. 

###### 24 
Proud, haughty, _and_ scornful _is_ his name that worketh in _his_ arrogancy wrath. 

###### 25 
The desire of the slothful slayeth him; for his hands refuse to work. 

###### 26 
He coveteth evermore greedily: but the righteous giveth and spareth not. 

###### 27 
The sacrifice of the wicked _is_ an abomination: how much more when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? 

###### 28 
A false witness shall perish: but he that heareth, speaketh continually. 

###### 29 
A wicked man hardeneth his face: but the just, he will direct his way. 

###### 30 
There is no wisdom, neither understanding, nor counsel against the Lord. 

###### 31 
The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but salvation _is_ of the Lord.
