###### 1 
My son, if thou be surety for thy neighbor, _and_ hast stricken hands with the stranger, 

###### 2 
Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth: thou art _even_ taken with the words of thine own mouth. 

###### 3 
Do this now, my Son, and deliver thyself: seeing thou art come into the hand of thy neighbor, go, and humble thyself, and solicit thy friends. 

###### 4 
Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids. 

###### 5 
Deliver thyself as a Doe from the hand _of the hunter_, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler. 

###### 6 
¶ Go to the pismire, O sluggard: behold her ways, and be wise. 

###### 7 
For she having no guide, governor, nor ruler, 

###### 8 
Prepareth her meat in the summer, _and_ gathereth her food in harvest. 

###### 9 
How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of the sleep? 

###### 10 
_Yet_ a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep. 

###### 11 
Therefore thy poverty cometh as one that traveleth by the way, and thy necessity like an armed man. 

###### 12 
The unthrifty man _and_ the wicked man walketh with a froward mouth. 

###### 13 
He maketh a sign with his eyes: he signifieth with his feet: he instructeth with his fingers. 

###### 14 
Lewd things _are_ in his heart: he imagineth evil at all times, _and_ raiseth up contentions. 

###### 15 
Therefore shall his destruction come speedily: he shall be destroyed suddenly without recovery. 

###### 16 
¶ These six things doth the Lord hate: yea, his soul abhorreth seven: 

###### 17 
The haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and the hands that shed innocent blood, 

###### 18 
An heart that imagineth wicked enterprises, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 

###### 19 
A false witness that speaketh lies, and him that raiseth up contentions among brethren. 

###### 20 
¶ My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not thy mother's instruction. 

###### 21 
Bind them always upon thine heart, _and_ tie them about thy neck. 

###### 22 
It shall lead thee when thou walkest: it shall watch for thee when thou sleepest, _and_ when thou wakest, it shall talk with thee. 

###### 23 
For the commandment _is_ a lantern, and instruction a light: and corrections for instruction _are_ the way of life, 

###### 24 
To keep thee from the wicked woman, _and_ from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman. 

###### 25 
Desire not her beauty in thine heart, neither let her take thee with her eye lids. 

###### 26 
For because of the whorish woman, _a man is brought_ to a morsel of bread, and a woman will hunt for the precious life of a man. 

###### 27 
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burnt? 

###### 28 
Or can a man go upon coals, and his feet not be burnt? 

###### 29 
So he that goeth into his neighbor's wife, shall not be innocent, whosoever toucheth her. 

###### 30 
Men do not despise a thief, when he stealeth to satisfy his soul, because he is hungry. 

###### 31 
But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold, _or_ he shall give all the substance of his house. 

###### 32 
But he that commiteth adultery with a woman, he is destitute of understanding: he that doeth it, destroyeth his own soul. 

###### 33 
He shall find a wound and dishonor, and his reproach shall never be put away. 

###### 34 
For jealousy _is_ the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. 

###### 35 
He cannot bear the sight of any ransom: neither will he consent, though thou augment the gifts.
