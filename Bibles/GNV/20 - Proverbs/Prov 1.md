###### 1 
The Parables of Solomon the son of David king of Israel, 

###### 2 
To know wisdom, and instruction, to understand the words of knowledge, 

###### 3 
To receive instruction to do wisely, _by_ justice and judgment and equity, 

###### 4 
To give unto the simple sharpness of wit, _and_ to the child knowledge and discretion. 

###### 5 
And wise man shall hear and increase in learning, and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels, 

###### 6 
To understand a parable, and the interpretation, the words of the wise, and their dark sayings. 

###### 7 
¶ The fear of the Lord _is_ the beginning of knowledge: _but_ fools despise wisdom and instruction. 

###### 8 
My son, hear thy father's instruction, and forsake not thy mother's teaching. 

###### 9 
For they shall be a comely ornament unto thine head, and _as_ chains for thy neck. 

###### 10 
¶ My son, if sinners do entice thee, consent thou not. 

###### 11 
If they say, Come with us, we will lay wait for blood, _and_ lie privily for the innocent without a cause: 

###### 12 
We will swallow them up alive like a grave, even whole, as those that go down into the pit: 

###### 13 
We shall find all precious riches, _and_ fill our houses with spoil: 

###### 14 
Cast in thy lot among us, we will all have one purse: 

###### 15 
My son, walk not thou in the way with them: refrain thy foot from their path. 

###### 16 
For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. 

###### 17 
Certainly _as_ without cause the net is spread before the eyes of all that hath wing: 

###### 18 
So they lay wait for blood, _and_ lie privily for their lives. 

###### 19 
Such _are_ the ways of everyone that is greedy of gain: he would take away the life of the owners thereof. 

###### 20 
¶ Wisdom crieth without: she uttereth her voice in the streets. 

###### 21 
She calleth in the high _street_, _among_ the prease in the enterings of the gates, _and_ uttereth her words in the city, _saying_, 

###### 22 
O ye foolish, how long will ye love foolishness? and the scornful take their pleasure in scorning? and the fools hate knowledge? 

###### 23 
(Turn you at my correction: lo, I will pour out my mind unto you, _and_ make you understand my words.) 

###### 24 
Because I have called, and ye refused: I have stretched out mine hand, and none would regard. 

###### 25 
But ye have despised all my counsel, and would none of my correction, 

###### 26 
I will also laugh at your destruction, _and_ mock when your fear cometh. 

###### 27 
When your fear cometh like _sudden_ desolation, and your destruction shall come like a whirlwind: when affliction and anguish shall come upon you, 

###### 28 
Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer: they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me, 

###### 29 
Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the Lord. 

###### 30 
They would none of my counsel, _but_ despised all my correction. 

###### 31 
Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. 

###### 32 
For ease slayeth the foolish, and the prosperity of fools destroyeth them. 

###### 33 
But he that obeyeth me, shall dwell safely, and be quiet from fear of evil.
