###### 1 
Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that abuseth his lips, and is a fool. 

###### 2 
For without knowledge the mind is not good, and he that hasteth with his feet, sinneth. 

###### 3 
The foolishness of a man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth against the Lord. 

###### 4 
Riches gather many friends: but the poor is separated from his neighbor. 

###### 5 
A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall not escape. 

###### 6 
Many reverence the face of the prince, and every man _is_ friend to him that giveth gifts. 

###### 7 
All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more will his friends depart far from him? though he be instant with words, _yet_ they will not. 

###### 8 
He that possesseth understanding, loveth his own soul, and keepeth wisdom to find goodness. 

###### 9 
A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies, shall perish. 

###### 10 
Pleasure is not comely for a fool, much less for a servant to have rule over princes. 

###### 11 
The discretion of man deferreth his anger: and his glory _is_ to pass by an offence. 

###### 12 
The king's wrath _is_ like the roaring of a lion: but his favor _is_ like the dew upon the grass. 

###### 13 
A foolish son _is_ the calamity of his father, and the contentions of a wife _are like_ a continual dropping. 

###### 14 
House and riches _are_ the inheritance of the fathers: but a prudent wife _cometh_ of the Lord. 

###### 15 
Slothfulness causeth to fall asleep, and a deceitful person shall be affamished. 

###### 16 
He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his own soul: _but_ he that despiseth his ways, shall die. 

###### 17 
He that hath mercy upon the poor, lendeth unto the Lord: and the Lord will recompense him that which he hath given. 

###### 18 
Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his murmuring. 

###### 19 
_A man_ of much anger shall suffer punishment, and though thou deliver _him_, yet will _his anger_ come again. 

###### 20 
Hear counsel and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end. 

###### 21 
Many devices _are_ in a man's heart: but the counsel of the Lord shall stand. 

###### 22 
That that is to be desired of a man, _is_ his goodness, and a poor man is better than a liar. 

###### 23 
The fear of the Lord _leadeth_ to life: and he that is filled _therewith_, shall continue, _and_ shall not be visited with evil. 

###### 24 
The slothful hideth his hand in _his_ bosom, and will not put it to his mouth again. 

###### 25 
Smite a scorner, and the foolish will beware: and reprove the prudent, and he will understand knowledge. 

###### 26 
He that destroyeth _his_ father, _or_ chaseth away _his_ mother, _is_ a lewd and shameful child. 

###### 27 
My son, hear no more the instruction, that causeth to err from the words of knowledge. 

###### 28 
A wicked witness mocketh at judgment, and the mouth of the wicked swalloweth up iniquity. 

###### 29 
_But_ judgments are prepared for the scorners, and stripes for the back of the fools.
