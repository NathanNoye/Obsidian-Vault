###### 1 
My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments within thee, 

###### 2 
And cause thine ears to hearken unto wisdom, _and_ incline thine heart to understanding, 

###### 3 
(For if thou callest after knowledge, _and_ cryest for understanding: 

###### 4 
If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for treasures, 

###### 5 
Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the knowledge of God. 

###### 6 
For the Lord giveth wisdom, out of his mouth _cometh_ knowledge and understanding. 

###### 7 
He preserveth the state of the righteous, _he is_ a shield to them that walk uprightly, 

###### 8 
That they may keep the ways of judgment: and he preserveth the way of his Saints). 

###### 9 
Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment, and equity, _and_ every good path. 

###### 10 
¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge delighteth thy soul, 

###### 11 
_Then_ shall counsel preserve thee, _and_ understanding shall keep thee, 

###### 12 
And deliver thee from the evil way, and from the man that speaketh froward things, 

###### 13 
_And from_ them that leave the ways of righteousness to walk in the ways of darkness: 

###### 14 
Which rejoice in doing evil, _and_ delight in the frowardness of the wicked, 

###### 15 
Whose ways are crooked, and they are lewd in their paths. 

###### 16 
And it shall deliver thee from the strange woman, _even_ from the stranger which flattereth with her words. 

###### 17 
Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God. 

###### 18 
Surely her house tendeth to death, and her paths unto the dead. 

###### 19 
All they that go unto her, return not again, neither take they hold of the ways of life. 

###### 20 
Therefore walk thou in the way of good men, and keep the ways of the righteous. 

###### 21 
For the just shall dwell in the land, and the upright men shall remain in it. 

###### 22 
But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressor shall be rooted out of it.
