###### 1 
As the snow in the Summer, and as the rain in the Harvest _are not meet_, so is honor unseemly for a fool. 

###### 2 
As the sparrow by flying, and the swallow by flying _escape_, so the curse _that is_ causeless, shall not come. 

###### 3 
Unto the horse _belongeth_ a whip, to the ass a bridle, and a rod to the fool's back. 

###### 4 
Answer not a fool according to his foolishness, lest thou also be like him. 

###### 5 
Answer a fool according to his foolishness, lest he be wise in his own conceit. 

###### 6 
He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool, _is as_ he that cutteth off the feet, and drinketh iniquity. 

###### 7 
_As_ they that lift up the legs of the lame, so _is_ a parable in a fool's mouth. 

###### 8 
As the closing up of a _precious_ stone in an heap of stones, so _is_ he that giveth glory to a fool. 

###### 9 
_As_ a thorn standing up in the hand of a drunkard, so _is_ a parable in the mouth of fools. 

###### 10 
The Excellent that formed all things, both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth the transgressors. 

###### 11 
As a dog turneth again to his own vomit, _so_ a fool turneth to his foolishness. 

###### 12 
Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? more hope _is_ of a fool than of him. 

###### 13 
The slothful man saith, A lion _is_ in the way: a lion _is_ in the streets. 

###### 14 
_As_ the door turneth upon his hinges, so _doth_ the slothful man upon his bed. 

###### 15 
The slothful hideth his hand in _his_ bosom, _and_ it grieveth him to put it again to his mouth. 

###### 16 
The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit, than seven _men_ that can render a reason. 

###### 17 
He that passeth by and medleth with the strife _that belongeth_ not unto him, _is as_ one that taketh a dog by the ears. 

###### 18 
As he that feigneth himself mad, casteth firebrands, arrows, and mortal things, 

###### 19 
So _dealeth_ the deceitful man with his friend, and saith, Am not I in sport? 

###### 20 
Without wood the fire is quenched, and without a talebearer strife ceaseth. 

###### 21 
_As_ the coal _maketh_ burning coals, and wood a fire, so the contentious man _is apt_ to kindle strife. 

###### 22 
The words of a talebearer _are_ as flatterings, and they go down into the bowels of the belly. 

###### 23 
_As_ silver dross overlaid upon a potsherd, _so are_ burning lips, and an evil heart. 

###### 24 
He that hateth, will counterfeit with his lips, but in his heart he layeth up deceit. 

###### 25 
Though he speak favorably, believe him not: for _there are_ seven abominations in his heart. 

###### 26 
Hatred may be covered by deceit: _but_ the malice thereof shall be discovered in the congregation. 

###### 27 
He that diggeth a pit shall fall therein, and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return unto him. 

###### 28 
A false tongue hateth the afflicted, and a flattering mouth causeth ruin.
