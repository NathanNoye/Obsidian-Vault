###### 1 
A good name is to be chosen above great riches, and loving favor is above silver and above gold. 

###### 2 
The rich and poor meet together, the Lord _is_ the maker of them all. 

###### 3 
A prudent man seeth the plague, and hideth himself: but the foolish go on still, and are punished. 

###### 4 
The reward of humility, _and_ the fear of God _is_ riches, and glory, and life. 

###### 5 
Thorns _and_ snares _are_ in the way of the froward: _but_ he that regardeth his soul, will depart far from them. 

###### 6 
Teach a child in the trade of his way, and when he _is_ old he shall not depart from it. 

###### 7 
The rich ruleth the poor, and the borrower _is_ servant to the man that lendeth. 

###### 8 
He that soweth iniquity, shall reap affliction, and the rod of his anger shall fail. 

###### 9 
He that hath a good eye, he shall be blessed: for he giveth of his bread unto the poor. 

###### 10 
Cast out the scorner, and strife shall go out: so contention and reproach shall cease. 

###### 11 
He that loveth pureness of heart _for_ the grace of his lips, the king _shall be_ his friend. 

###### 12 
The eyes of the Lord preserve knowledge: but he overthroweth the words of the transgressor. 

###### 13 
The slothful man saith, A lion _is_ without, I shall be slain in the street. 

###### 14 
The mouth of strange women _is as_ a deep pit: he with whom the Lord is angry, shall fall therein. 

###### 15 
Foolishness _is_ bound in the heart of a child: but the rod of correction shall drive it away from him. 

###### 16 
He that oppresseth the poor to increase himself, _and_ giveth unto the rich, _shall_ surely _come_ to poverty. 

###### 17 
¶ Incline thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge. 

###### 18 
For _it shall be_ pleasant, if thou keep them in thy belly, _and if_ they be directed together in thy lips. 

###### 19 
That thy confidence may be in the Lord, I have showed thee this day: thou therefore _take heed_. 

###### 20 
Have not I written unto thee three times in counsels and knowledge, 

###### 21 
That I might show thee the assurance of the words of truth, to answer the words of truth to them that send to thee? 

###### 22 
Rob not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in judgment. 

###### 23 
For the Lord will defend their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoil them. 

###### 24 
Make no friendship with an angry man, neither go with the furious man, 

###### 25 
Lest thou learn his ways, and receive destruction to thy soul. 

###### 26 
Be not thou of them that tough the hand, _nor_ among them that are surety for debts. 

###### 27 
If thou hast nothing to pay, why _causest thou_ that he should take thy bed from under thee? 

###### 28 
Thou shalt not remove the ancient bounds which thy fathers have made. 

###### 29 
Thou seest that a diligent man in his business standeth before Kings, _and_ standeth not before the base sort.
