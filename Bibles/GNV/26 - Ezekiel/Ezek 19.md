###### 1 
Thou also take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, 

###### 2 
And say, Wherefore lay thy mother _as_ a lioness among the lions? she nourished her young ones among the lion's whelps, 

###### 3 
And she brought up one of her whelps, _and_ it became a lion, and it learned to catch the prey, _and_ it devoured men. 

###### 4 
The nations also heard of him, _and_ he was taken in their nets, and they brought him in chains unto the land of Egypt. 

###### 5 
Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, she took another of her whelps, and made him a lion. 

###### 6 
Which went among the lions, _and_ became a lion, and learned to catch the prey, _and_ he devoured men. 

###### 7 
And he knew their widows, and he destroyed their cities, and the land was wasted, and all that was therein by the noise of his roaring. 

###### 8 
Then the nations set against him on every side of the countries, and laid their nets for him: so he was taken in their pit. 

###### 9 
And they put him in prison _and_ in chains, and brought him to the king of Babel, _and_ they put him in holds, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. 

###### 10 
Thy mother _is_ like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she brought forth fruit and branches by the abundant waters, 

###### 11 
And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bear rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches. 

###### 12 
But she was plucked up in wrath: she was cast down to the ground, and the East wind dried up her fruit: _her branches_ were broken and withered: _as for_ the rod of her strength, the fire consumed it. 

###### 13 
And now she is planted in the wilderness in a dry and thirsty ground. 

###### 14 
And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit, so that she hath no strong rod _to be_ a scepter to rule: this is a lamentation, and shall be for a lamentation.
