###### 1 
The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, 

###### 2 
Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and drop _thy word_ toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel, 

###### 3 
And say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I _come_ against thee, and will draw my sword out of his sheath, and cut off from thee _both_ the righteous and the wicked. 

###### 4 
Seeing then that I will cut off from thee _both_ the righteous and wicked, therefore shall my sword go out of his sheath against all flesh from the South to the North, 

###### 5 
That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of his sheath, _and_ it shall not return anymore. 

###### 6 
Mourn therefore thou son of man, _as_ in the pain of _thy_ reins, and mourn bitterly before them. 

###### 7 
And if they say unto thee, Wherefore mournest thou? Then answer, Because of the bruit: for it cometh, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be weak, and all minds shall faint, and all knees shall fall away _as_ water: behold, it cometh, and shall be done, saith the Lord God. 

###### 8 
¶ Again, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 9 
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord God, say, A sword, a sword both sharp and furbished. 

###### 10 
It is sharpened to make a sore slaughter, _and_ it is furbished that it may glitter: how shall we rejoice? _for_ it contemneth the rod of my son, _as_ all _other_ trees. 

###### 11 
And he hath given it to be furbished, that he may handle it: this sword is sharp, and is furbished that he may give it into the hand of the slayer. 

###### 12 
Cry and howl, son of man: for this shall come to my people, _and_ it shall come unto all the princes of Israel: the terrors of the sword shall be upon my people, smite therefore upon thy thigh. 

###### 13 
For _it is_ a trial, and what shall this be, if _the sword_ contemn even the rod? It shall be _no more_, saith the Lord God. 

###### 14 
Thou therefore, son of man, prophesy and smite hand to hand, and let the sword be doubled: let the sword that hath killed, _return_ the third time: it is the sword of the great slaughter entering into their privy chambers. 

###### 15 
I have brought the fear of the sword into all their gates to make _their_ heart to faint, and to multiply _their_ ruins. Ah, it is made bright, _and_ it is dressed for the slaughter. 

###### 16 
Get thee alone: go to the right hand, _or_ get thyself to the left hand, whithersoever thy face turneth. 

###### 17 
I will also smite mine hands together, and will cause my wrath to cease. I the Lord have said it. 

###### 18 
¶ The word of the Lord came unto me again, saying, 

###### 19 
Also thou son of man, appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the King of Babel may come: both twain shall come out of one land, and choose a place, and choose it in the corner of the way of the city. 

###### 20 
Appoint a way, that the sword may come to Rabbah of the Ammonites, and to Judah in Jerusalem the strong _city_. 

###### 21 
And the King of Babel stood at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, consulting by divination, _and_ made his arrows bright: he consulted with idols, _and_ looked in the liver. 

###### 22 
At his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem to appoint captains to open _their_ mouth in the slaughter, and to lift up their voice with shouting, to lay engines of war against the gates, to cast a mount, _and_ to build a fortress. 

###### 23 
And it shall be unto them as a false divination in their sight for the oaths made unto them: but he will call to remembrance _their_ iniquity, to the intent they should be taken. 

###### 24 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Because ye have made your iniquity to be remembered in discovering your rebellion, that in all your works your sins might appear: because, _I say_, that ye are come to remembrance, ye shall be taken with the hand. 

###### 25 
And thou Prince of Israel polluted, _and_ wicked, whose day is come, when iniquity _shall have _an end, 

###### 26 
Thus saith the Lord God, I will take away the diadem, and take off the crown: this shall be no more the same: I will exalt the humble, and will abase him that is high. 

###### 27 
I will overturn, overturn, overturn it, and it shall be no more until he come, whose right it is, and I will give it him. 

###### 28 
¶ And thou, son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord God to the children of Ammon, and to their blasphemy: say thou, I say, The sword, the sword is drawn forth _and_ furbished to the slaughter, to consume, because of the glittering, 

###### 29 
While they see vanity unto thee, and prophesied a lie unto thee to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are slain, whose day is come, when their iniquity _shall have_ an end. 

###### 30 
Shall I cause it to return into his sheath? I will judge thee in the place where thou wast created, _even_ in the land of thine habitation. 

###### 31 
And I will pour out mine indignation upon thee, and will blow against thee in the fire of my wrath, and deliver thee into the hand of beastly men, _and_ skillful to destroy. 

###### 32 
Thou shalt be in the fire to be devoured: thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, _and_ thou shalt be no more remembered: for I the Lord have spoken it.
