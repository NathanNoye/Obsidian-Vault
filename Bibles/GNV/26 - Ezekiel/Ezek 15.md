###### 1 
And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 2 
Son of man, what cometh of the vine tree above all _other_ trees? and of the vine branch, which is among the trees of the forest? 

###### 3 
Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon? 

###### 4 
Behold, it is cast in the fire to be consumed: the fire consumeth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burnt. Is it meet for _any_ work? 

###### 5 
Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet for any work, when the fire hath consumed it, and it is burnt? 

###### 6 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, as the vine tree, _that is_ among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 

###### 7 
And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from _one_ fire, and _another_ fire shall consume them: and ye shall know, that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them, 

###### 8 
And _when_ I make the land waste, because they have greatly offended, saith the Lord God.
