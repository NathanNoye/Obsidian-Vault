Moreover, when ye shall divide the land for inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the Lord an holy portion of the land, five and twenty thousand reeds long, and ten thousand broad: this shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about. 

###### 2 
Of this there shall be for the Sanctuary five hundred _in length_, with five hundred _in breadth_, all square round about, and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof. 

###### 3 
And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it shall be the Sanctuary, _and_ the most holy place. 

###### 4 
The holy portion of the land shall be the Priests, which minister in the Sanctuary, which came near to serve the Lord: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the Sanctuary. 

###### 5 
And _in_ the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten thousand of breadth shall the Levites that minister in the house, have their possession for twenty chambers.

###### 7 
And _a portion shall be_ for the prince on the one side, and on that side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, _even_ before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city from the West corner Westward, and from the East corner Eastward, and the length _shall be_ by one of the portions from the West border unto the East border. 

###### 8 
In this land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes shall no more oppress my people, and _the rest_ of the land shall they give to the house of Israel, according to their tribes. 

###### 9 
Thus saith the Lord God, Let it suffice you, O princes of Israel: leave off cruelty and oppression, and execute judgment and justice: take away your exactions from my people, saith the Lord God. 

###### 10 
Ye shall have just balances, and a true Ephah, and a true Bath. 

###### 11

###### 14 
Concerning the ordinance of the oil, _even_ of the Bath of oil, _ye shall offer_ the tenth part of a Bath out of the Cor (ten Baths _are_ an Homer: for ten Baths _fill_ an Homer)

And one Lamb of two hundred sheep out of the fat pastures of Israel for a meat offering, and for a burnt offering and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for them, saith the Lord God.

###### 17 
And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and drink offerings in the solemn feasts and in the new moons, and in the Sabbaths, _and_ in all the high feasts of the house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

And the Priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering, and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four corners of the frame of the altar, and upon the posts of the gate of the inner court. 

###### 20 
And so shalt thou do the seventh _day_ of the month, for everyone that hath erred, and for him that is deceived: so shall you reconcile the house. 

###### 21 
In the first _month_ in the fourteenth day of the month, ye shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days, _and_ ye shall eat unleavened bread.
