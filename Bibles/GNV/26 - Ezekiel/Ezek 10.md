###### 1 
And as I looked, behold in the firmament that was above the head of the Cherubims there appeared upon them like unto the similitude of a throne, as _it were_ a sapphire stone. 

###### 2 
And he spake unto the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, _even_ under the Cherub, and fill thine hands with coals of fire from between the Cherubims, and scatter them over the city. And he went in my sight. 

###### 3 
Now the Cherubims stood upon the right side of the house, when the man went in, and the cloud filled the inner court. 

###### 4 
Then the glory of the Lord went up from the Cherub, _and stood_ over the door of the house, and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the Lord's glory. 

###### 5 
And the sound of the Cherubims' wings was heard into the utter court, as the voice of the Almighty God, when he speaketh. 

###### 6 
And when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, _and_ from between the Cherubims, then he went in and stood beside the wheel. 

###### 7 
And one Cherub stretched forth his hand from between the Cherubims unto the fire that was between the Cherubims, and took _thereof_, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went out. 

###### 8 
And there appeared in the Cherubims, the likeness of a man's hand under their wings. 

###### 9 
And when I looked up, behold, four wheels _were_ beside the Cherubims, one wheel by one Cherub, and another wheel by another Cherub, and the appearance of the wheels _was_ as the color of a Chrysolite stone. 

###### 10 
And their appearance (_for_ they were _all_ four of one fashion) was as if one wheel had been in _another_ wheel. 

###### 11 
When they went forth, they went upon their four sides, and they returned not as they went: but to the place whither the first went, they went after it, _and_ they turned not as they went. 

###### 12 
And their whole body, and their rings, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels were full of eyes round about, _even_ in the same four wheels. 

###### 13 
And the _Cherub_ cried to these wheels in mine hearing, _saying_, O wheel. 

###### 14 
And every _beast_ had four faces: the first face _was_ the face of a Cherub, and the second face _was_ the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an Eagle. 

###### 15 
And the Cherubims were lifted up: this is the beast that I saw at the river Chebar. 

###### 16 
And when the Cherubims went, the wheels went by them: and when the Cherubims lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the same wheels also turned not from beside them. 

###### 17 
When the _Cherubims_ stood, they stood: and when they were lifted up, they lifted themselves up _also_: for the spirit of the beast _was_ in them. 

###### 18 
Then the glory of the Lord departed from above the door of the house, and stood upon the Cherubims. 

###### 19 
And the Cherubims lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight: when they went out, the wheels also _were_ beside them: and _everyone_ stood at the entry of the gate of the Lord's House at the East side, and the glory of the God of Israel _was_ upon them on high. 

###### 20 
This is the beast that I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chebar, and I knew that they were the Cherubims. 

###### 21 
Every one had four faces, and every one four wings, and the likeness of man's hands _was_ under their wings. 

###### 22 
And the likeness of their faces _was_ the selfsame faces, which I saw by the river Chebar, _and_ the appearance of the _Cherubims was_ the selfsame, _and_ they went every one straight forward.
