###### 1 
Moreover, the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me unto the East gate of the Lord's house, which lieth Eastward, and behold, at the entry of the gate _were_ five and twenty men: among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azzur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, the princes of the people. 

###### 2 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, these are the men that imagine mischief, and devise wicked counsel in this city. 

###### 3 
_For_ they say, It is not near, let us build houses: this _city_ is the caldron, and we be the flesh. 

###### 4 
Therefore prophesy against them, son of man, prophesy. 

###### 5 
And the Spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak, Thus saith the Lord, O ye house of Israel, this have ye said, and I know that which riseth up of your minds. 

###### 6 
Many have ye murdered in this city, and ye have filled the streets thereof with the slain. 

###### 7 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, They that ye have slain, and have laid in the midst of it, they are the flesh, and this _city_ is the caldron, but I will bring you forth of the midst of it. 

###### 8 
Ye have feared the sword, and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord God. 

###### 9 
And I will bring you out of the midst thereof, and deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute judgments among you. 

###### 10 
Ye shall fall by the sword, _and_ I will judge you in the border of Israel, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 

###### 11 
This _city_ shall not be your caldron, neither shall ye be the flesh in the midst thereof, _but_ I will judge you in the border of Israel. 

###### 12 
And ye shall know that I am the Lord: for ye have not walked in my statutes, neither executed my judgments, but have done after the manners of the heathen that are round about you. 

###### 13 
¶ And when I prophesied, Pelatiah the son of Benaiah died: then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord God, wilt thou then utterly destroy all the remnant of Israel? 

###### 14 
Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 15 
Son of man, thy brethren, _even_ thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, wholly _are they_ unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Depart ye far from the Lord: _for_ the land is given us in possession. 

###### 16 
Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God, Although I have cast them far off among the heathen, and although I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them as a little Sanctuary in the countries where they shall come. 

###### 17 
Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord God, I will gather you again from the people, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. 

###### 18 
And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the idols thereof, and all the abominations thereof from thence. 

###### 19 
And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within their bowels: and I will take the stony heart out of their bodies, and will give them an heart of flesh, 

###### 20 
That they may walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and execute them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. 

###### 21 
But upon them, whose heart is toward their idols, and whose affection goeth after their abominations, I will lay their way upon their own heads saith the Lord God. 

###### 22 
¶ Then did the Cherubims lift up their wings, and the wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel _was_ upon them on high. 

###### 23 
And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is toward the East side of the city. 

###### 24 
Afterward the Spirit took me up, and brought me in a vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea to them that were led away captives: so the vision that I had seen, went up from me. 

###### 25 
Then I declared unto them that were led away captives, all the things that the Lord had showed me.
