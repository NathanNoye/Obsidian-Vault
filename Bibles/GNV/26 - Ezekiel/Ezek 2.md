###### 1 
And he said unto me, Son of man, stand up upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee. 

###### 2 
And the Spirit entered into me, when he had spoken unto me, and set me upon my feet, so that I heard him that spake unto me. 

###### 3 
And he said unto me, Son of Man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: _for_ they and their fathers have rebelled against me, even unto this very day. 

###### 4 
For _they are_ impudent children, and stiff-hearted: I do send thee unto them, and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God. 

###### 5 
But surely they will not hear, neither indeed will they cease: for they are a rebellious house: yet shall they know that there hath been a Prophet among them. 

###### 6 
And thou son of man, fear them not, neither be afraid of their words, although rebels and thorns _be_ with thee, and thou remainest with scorpions: fear not their words, nor be afraid at their looks, for they are a rebellious house. 

###### 7 
Therefore thou shalt speak my words unto them: _but_ surely they will not hear, neither will they indeed cease: for they are rebellious. 

###### 8 
But thou son of man, hear what I say unto thee: be not thou rebellious, like _this_ rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee. 

###### 9 
And when I looked up, behold, an hand was sent unto me, and lo, a roll of a book _was_ therein. 

###### 10 
And he spread it before me, and it was written within and without, and there was written therein, Lamentations and mourning, and woe.
