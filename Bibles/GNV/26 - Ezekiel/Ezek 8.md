###### 1 
And in the sixth year, in the sixth _month_, _and_ in the fifth _day_ of the month, as I sat in mine house, and the Elders of Judah sat before me, the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me. 

###### 2 
Then I beheld, and lo, _there was_ a likeness, as the appearance of fire, to look to, from his loins downward, and from his loins upward, as the appearance of brightness, and like unto amber. 

###### 3 
And he stretched out the likeness of an hand, and took me by an hairy lock of mine head, and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me by a Divine vision to Jerusalem, into the entry of the inner gate that lieth toward the North, where remained the idol of indignation, which provoked indignation. 

###### 4 
And behold, the glory of the God of Israel _was_ there according to the vision, that I saw in the field. 

###### 5 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now toward the North. So I lifted up mine eyes toward the North, and behold, Northward, at the gate of the altar, this idol of indignation _was_ in the entry. 

###### 6 
He said furthermore unto me, Son of man, seest thou not what they do? _even_ the great abominations that the house of Israel commiteth here to cause _me_ to depart from my Sanctuary? but yet turn thee _and_ thou shalt see greater abominations. 

###### 7 
And he caused me to enter at the gate of the court: and when I looked, behold, an hole _was_ in the wall. 

###### 8 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, dig now in the wall. And when I had dug in the wall, behold, _there was_ a door. 

###### 9 
And he said unto me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here. 

###### 10 
So I went in, and saw, and behold, _there was_ every similitude of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel painted upon the wall round about. 

###### 11 
And there stood before them seventy men of the Ancients of the house of Israel, and in the midst of them stood Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan, with every man his censor in his hand, and the vapor of the incense went up _like _a cloud. 

###### 12 
Then said he unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen what the Ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, everyone in the chamber of his imagery? for they say, The Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth. 

###### 13 
Again he said also unto me, Turn thee again, _and_ thou shalt see greater abominations that they do. 

###### 14 
And he caused me to enter into the entry of the gate of the Lord's house, which was toward the North: and behold, there sat women mourning for Tammuz. 

###### 15 
Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen _this_, O son of man? Turn thee again, _and_ thou shalt see greater abominations than these. 

###### 16 
And he caused me to enter into the inner court of the Lord's house, and behold, at the door of the Temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar _were_ about five and twenty men with their backs toward the Temple of the Lord, and their faces toward the East, and they worshipped the sun, toward the East. 

###### 17 
Then he said unto me, Hast thou seen _this_, O son of man? Is it a small thing to the house of Judah to commit these abominations which they do here? for they have filled the land with cruelty, and have returned to provoke me: and lo, they have cast out stink before their noses. 

###### 18 
Therefore will I also execute _my_ wrath: mine eye shall not spare _them_, neither will I have pity, and though they cry in mine ears with a loud voice, _yet_ will I not hear them.
