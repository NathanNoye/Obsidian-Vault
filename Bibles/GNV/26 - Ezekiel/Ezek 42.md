###### 1 
Then brought he me into the utter court by the way toward the North, and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate place, and which was before the building toward the North. 

###### 2 
Before the length of an hundred cubits, _was_ the North door, and _it was_ fifty cubits broad. 

###### 3 
Over against the twenty _cubits_ which were for the inner court, and over against the pavement, which was for the utter court, was chamber against chamber in three rows. 

###### 4 
And before the chambers _was_ a gallery of ten cubits wide, _and_ within _was_ a way of one cubit, and their doors toward the North. 

###### 5 
Now the chambers above were narrower: for those chambers _seemed_ to eat up these, _to wit_, the lower, and those that were in the midst of the building. 

###### 6 
For they were in three rows, but had not pillars as the pillars of the court: therefore there was a difference from them beneath and from the middlemost, _even_ from the ground. 

###### 7 
And the wall that was without over against the chambers, toward the utter court on the forefront of the chambers, _was_ fifty cubits long. 

###### 8 
For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court, _was_ fifty cubits: and lo, before the Temple _were_ an hundred cubits. 

###### 9 
And under these chambers _was_ the entry, on the East side, as one goeth into them from the outward court. 

###### 10 
The chambers _were_ in the thickness of the wall of the court toward the East, over against the separate place, and over against the building. 

###### 11 
And the way before them _was_ after the manner of the chambers, which were toward the North, as long as they, _and_ as broad as they: and all their entries were like, both according to their fashions, and according to their doors. 

###### 12 
And according to the doors of the chambers, that were toward the South, _was_ a door in the corner of the way, _even_ the way directly before the wall toward the East, as one entereth. 

###### 13 
Then said he unto me, The North chambers _and_ the South chambers which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers wherein the Priests that approach unto the Lord, shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering: for the place _is_ holy. 

###### 14 
When the Priests enter therein, they shall not go out of the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay their garments wherein they minister: for they are holy, _and_ shall put on other garments, and so shall approach to those things, which are for the people. 

###### 15 
Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the East, and measured it round about. 

###### 16 
He measured the East side with the measuring rod, five hundred reeds _even_ with the measuring reed round about. 

###### 17 
He measured _also_ the North side, five hundred reeds, _even_ with the measuring reed round about. 

###### 18 
And he measured the South side five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 

###### 19 
He turned about _also_ to the West side, _and_ measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed. 

###### 20 
He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about, five hundred _reeds_ long, and five hundred broad to make a separation between the Sanctuary, and the profane place.
