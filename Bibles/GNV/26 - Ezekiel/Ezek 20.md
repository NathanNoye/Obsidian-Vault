###### 1 
And in the seventh year, in the fifth _month_, the tenth _day_ of the month, came certain of the Elders of Israel to inquire of the Lord, and sat before me. 

###### 2 
Then came the word of the Lord unto me, saying, 

###### 3 
Son of man, speak unto the Elders of Israel, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye come to inquire of me? as I live, saith the Lord God, when I am asked, I will not answer you. 

###### 4 
Wilt thou judge them, son of man? wilt thou judge _them_? cause them to understand the abominations of their fathers, 

###### 5 
And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up mine hand unto the seed of the house of Jacob, and made myself known unto them in the land of Egypt, when I lift up mine hand unto them, and said, I am the Lord your God, 

###### 6 
In the day that I lifted up mine hand unto them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt, into a land that I had provided for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is pleasant among all lands, 

###### 7 
Then said I unto them, Let every man cast away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: _for_ I am the Lord your God. 

###### 8 
But they rebelled against me, and would not hear me: _for_ none cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I thought to pour out mine indignation upon them, _and_ to accomplish my wrath against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. 

###### 9 
But I had respect to my Name, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, and in whose sight I made myself known unto them in bringing them forth of the land of Egypt. 

###### 10 
Now I carried them out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderness. 

###### 11 
And I gave them my statutes, and declared my judgments unto them, which if a man do, he shall live in them. 

###### 12 
Moreover I gave them also my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord, that sanctify them. 

###### 13 
But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them, and my Sabbaths have they greatly polluted: then I thought to pour out mine indignation upon them in the wilderness to consume them, 

###### 14 
But I had respect to my name, that it should not be polluted before the heathen in whose sight I brought them out. 

###### 15 
Yet nevertheless, I lifted up mine hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would not bring them into the land, which I had given them, flowing with milk and honey, which was pleasant above all lands, 

###### 16 
Because they cast away my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, but have polluted my Sabbaths: for their heart went after their idols. 

###### 17 
Nevertheless, mine eye spared them, that I would not destroy them, neither would I consume them in the wilderness. 

###### 18 
But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the ordinances of your fathers, neither observe their manners, nor defile yourselves with their idols. 

###### 19 
I am the Lord your God: walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments and do them, 

###### 20 
And sanctify my Sabbaths, and they shall be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord your God. 

###### 21 
Notwithstanding the children rebelled against me: they walked not in my statutes, nor kept my judgments to do them, which if a man do, he shall live in them, _but_ they polluted my Sabbaths: then I thought to pour out mine indignation upon them, _and_ to accomplish my wrath against them in the wilderness. 

###### 22 
Nevertheless, I withdrew mine hand and had respect to my Name, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, in whose sight I brought them forth. 

###### 23 
Yet I lifted up mine hand unto them in the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the heathen, and disperse them through the countries, 

###### 24 
Because they had not executed my judgments, but had cast away my statutes, and had polluted my Sabbaths, and their eyes were after their fathers' idols. 

###### 25 
Wherefore I gave them also statutes that were not good, and judgments, wherein they should not live. 

###### 26 
And I polluted them in their own gifts in that they caused to pass _by the fire_ all that _first_ openeth the womb, that I might destroy them, to the end that they might know that I am the Lord. 

###### 27 
Therefore, son of man, speak unto the house of Israel and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Yet in this your fathers have blasphemed me, though they had _before_ grievously transgressed against me. 

###### 28 
For when I had brought them into the land, for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to them, then they saw every high hill, and all the thick trees, and they offered there their sacrifices, and there they presented their offering of provocation: there also they made their sweet savor, and poured out there their drink offerings. 

###### 29 
Then I said unto them, What is the high place whereunto ye go? And the name thereof was called Bamah unto this day. 

###### 30 
Wherefore, say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Are ye not polluted after the manner of your fathers? and commit ye not whoredom after their abominations? 

###### 31 
For when you offer your gifts, and make your sons to pass through the fire, you pollute yourselves with all your idols unto this day: shall I answer you when I am asked, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not answer you when I am asked. 

###### 32 
Neither shall that be done that cometh into your mind: for ye say, we will be as the heathen, and as the families of the countries, and serve wood, and stone. 

###### 33 
As I live, saith the Lord God, I will surely rule you with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and in _my_ wrath poured out, 

###### 34 
And will bring you from the people, and will gather you out of the countries, wherein ye are scattered, with a mighty hand, and with a stretched out arm, and in _my_ wrath poured out, 

###### 35 
And I will bring you into the wilderness of the people, and there will I plead with you face to face. 

###### 36 
Like as I pleaded with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I plead with you, saith the Lord God. 

###### 37 
And I will cause you to pass under the rod, and will bring you into the bond of the covenant. 

###### 38 
And I will choose out from among you the rebels, and them that transgress against me: I will bring them out of the land where they dwell, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel, and ye shall know that I am the Lord. 

###### 39 
As for you, O house of Israel, thus saith the Lord God, Go you, and serve everyone his idol, seeing that ye will not obey me, and pollute mine holy Name no more with your gifts, and with your idols. 

###### 40 
For in mine holy mountain, _even_ in the high mountain of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel, and all in the land serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the firstfruits of your oblations, with all your holy things. 

###### 41 
I will accept your sweet savor, when I bring you from the people, and gather you out of the countries, wherein ye have been scattered, that I may be sanctified in you before the heathen. 

###### 42 
And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall bring you into the land of Israel, into the land for the which I lifted up mine hand to give it to your fathers. 

###### 43 
And there shall ye remember your ways, and all your works, wherein ye have been defiled, and ye shall judge yourselves worthy to be cut off, for all your evils, that ye have committed. 

###### 44 
And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have respect unto you for my Name's sake, _and_ not after your wicked ways, nor according to your corrupt works, O ye house of Israel, saith the Lord God. 

###### 45 
¶ Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 46 
Son of man, Set thy face toward the way of Teman, and drop _thy word_ toward the South, and prophesy toward the forest of the field of the South, 

###### 47 
And say to the forest of the South, Hear the word of the Lord: thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I will kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour all the green wood in thee, and all the dry wood: the continual flame shall not be quenched, and every face from the South to the North shall be burnt therein. 

###### 48 
And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord have kindled it, _and_ it shall not be quenched. Then said I, Ah Lord God, they say of me, Doth not he speak parables?
