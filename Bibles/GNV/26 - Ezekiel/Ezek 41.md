###### 1 
Afterward, he brought me to the Temple and measured the posts, six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side, _which was_ the breadth of the Tabernacle. 

###### 2 
And the breadth of the entry _was_ ten cubits, and the sides of the entry _were_ five cubits, on the one side, and five cubits on the other side, and he measured the length thereof forty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits. 

###### 3 
Then went he in, and measured the posts of the entry two cubits, and the entry six cubits, and the breadth of the entry seven cubits. 

###### 4 
So he measured the length thereof twenty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits before the Temple, and he said unto me, This is the most holy place. 

###### 5 
After, he measured the wall of the house, six cubits, and the breadth of _every_ chamber four cubits round about the house, on every side. 

###### 6 
And the chambers _were_ chamber upon chamber, three and thirty foot _high_, and they entered into the wall made for the chambers which was round about the house, that _the posts_ might be fastened _therein_, and not be fastened in the wall of the house. 

###### 7 
And it was large, and went round mounting upward to the chambers: for the stairs of the house _was_ mounting upward, round about the house: therefore the house was larger upward: so they went up from the lowest _chamber_ to the highest by the midst. 

###### 8 
I saw also the house high round about: the foundations of the chambers _were_ a full reed of six great cubits. 

###### 9 
The thickness of the wall which was for the chamber without, _was_ five cubits, and that which remained, _was_ the place of the chambers that were within. 

###### 10 
And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits round about the House on every side. 

###### 11 
And the doors of the chambers _were_ toward the place that remained, one door toward the North, and another door toward the South, and the breadth of the place that remained, _was_ five cubits round about. 

###### 12 
Now the building that was before the separate place toward the West corner, _was_ seventy cubits broad, and the wall of the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length ninety cubits. 

###### 13 
So he measured the house an hundred cubits long, and the separate place and the building with the walls thereof _were_ an hundred cubits long. 

###### 14 
Also the breadth of the forefront of the house and of the separate place toward the East, _was_ an hundred cubits. 

###### 15 
And he measured the length of the building over against the separate place, which was behind it, and the chambers on the one side and on the other side an hundred cubits with the Temple within, and the arches of the court. 

###### 16 
The posts and the narrow windows, and the chambers round about, on three sides over against the posts, ceiled with _cedar_ wood round about, and from the ground up to the windows, and the windows were ceiled. 

###### 17 
And from above the door unto the inner house and without, and by all the wall round about within and without it was _ceiled according_ to the measure. 

###### 18 
And it was made with Cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm tree _was_ between a Cherub and a Cherub: and _every_ Cherub had two faces. 

###### 19 
So that the face of a man _was_ toward the palm tree on the one side, and the face of a lion toward the palm tree on the other side: _thus_ was it made through all the house round about. 

###### 20 
From the ground unto above the door _were_ Cherubims, and palm trees made as in the wall of the Temple. 

###### 21 
The posts of the Temple were squared, _and_ thus to look unto _was_ the similitude _and_ form of the Sanctuary. 

###### 22 
The altar of wood _was_ three cubits high, and the length thereof two cubits, and the corners thereof and the length thereof and the sides thereof _were_ of wood. And he said unto me, This is the Table that shall be before the Lord. 

###### 23 
And the Temple and the Sanctuary had two doors. 

###### 24 
And the doors had two wickets, _even_ two turning wickets, two wickets for one door, and two wickets for another door. 

###### 25 
And upon the doors of the Temple there were made Cherubims and palm trees, like as was made upon the walls, and _there were_ thick planks upon the forefront of the porch without. 

###### 26 
And _there were_ narrow windows and palm trees on the one side, and on the other side, by the sides of the porch, and _upon_ the sides of the house, and thick planks.
