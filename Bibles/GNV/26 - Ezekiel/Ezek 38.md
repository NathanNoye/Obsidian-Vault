###### 1 
And the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 2 
Son of men, set thy face against Gog, _and against_ the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him, 

###### 3 
And say, Thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I _come_ against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal. 

###### 4 
And I will destroy thee, and put hooks in thy jaws, and I will bring thee forth and all thine host, _both_ horses and horsemen, all clothed with all sorts of _armor, even_ a great multitude with bucklers and shields, all handling swords. 

###### 5 
They of Paras, of Cush, and Put with them, _even_ all they _that bear_ shield and helmet. 

###### 6 
Gomer and all his bands, _and_ the house of Togarmah of the North quarters, and all his bands, _and_ much people with thee. 

###### 7 
Prepare thyself, and make thee ready, _both_ thou, and all thy multitude that are assembled unto thee, and be thou their safeguard. 

###### 8 
After many days thou shalt be visited: _for_ in the latter years thou shalt come into the land that hath been destroyed with the sword, and is gathered out of many people upon the mountains of Israel, which have long lain waste: yet they have been brought out of the people, and they shall dwell all safe. 

###### 9 
Thou shalt ascend and come up like a tempest, _and_ shalt be like a cloud to cover the land, _both_ thou, and all thy bands, and many people with thee. 

###### 10 
Thus saith the Lord God, Even at the same time shall _many_ things come into thy mind, and thou shalt think evil thoughts. 

###### 11 
And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land that hath no walled towers: I will go to them that are at rest and dwell in safety, which dwell all without walls, and have neither bars nor gates, 

###### 12 
_Thinking_ to spoil the prey, and to take a booty, to turn thine hand upon the desolate places that are _now_ inhabited, and upon the people that are gathered out of the nations which have gotten cattle, and goods, and dwell in the midst of the land. 

###### 13 
Sheba and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish with all the lions thereof shall say unto thee, Art thou come to spoil the prey? hast thou gathered thy multitude to take a booty? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, _and_ to spoil a great prey? 

###### 14 
Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and say unto Gog, Thus saith the Lord God, In that day, when my people of Israel dwelleth safe shalt thou not know it, 

###### 15 
And come from thy place out of the North parts, thou and much people with thee? all _shall_ ride upon horses, _even_ a great multitude and a mighty army. 

###### 16 
And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land, thou shalt be in the latter days, and I will bring thee upon my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. 

###### 17 
Thus saith the Lord God, Art not thou he, of whom I have spoken in old time, by the hand of my servants the Prophets of Israel which prophesied in those days and years, that I would bring thee upon them? 

###### 18 
At the same time also when Gog shall come against the land of Israel, saith the Lord God, my wrath shall arise in mine anger. 

###### 19 
For in mine indignation, _and_ in the fire of my wrath have I spoken it: surely at that time there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel, 

###### 20 
So that the fishes of the Sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all that move and creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the earth, shall tremble at my presence, and the mountains shall be overthrown, and the stairs shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. 

###### 21 
For I will call for a sword against him throughout all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be against his brother. 

###### 22 
And I will plead against him with pestilence, and with blood, and I will cause to rain upon him and upon his bands, and upon the great people that are with him, a sore rain, and hailstones, fire, and brimstone. 

###### 23 
Thus will I be magnified, and sanctified, and known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know, that I am the Lord.
