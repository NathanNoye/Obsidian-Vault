###### 1 
Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth _day_ of the month, came the word of the Lord unto me, saying, 

###### 2 
Son of man, write thee the name of the day, _even_ of this same day: _for_ the King of Babel set himself against Jerusalem this same day. 

###### 3 
Therefore speak a parable unto the rebellious house, and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord God, Prepare a pot, prepare it, and also pour water into it. 

###### 4 
Gather the pieces thereof into it, _even_ every good piece, _as_ the thigh and the shoulder, _and_ fill it with the chief bones. 

###### 5 
Take one of the best sheep, and burn also the bones under it, _and_ make it boil well, and seethe the bones of it therein, 

###### 6 
Because the Lord God saith thus, Woe to the bloody city, _even_ to the pot, whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it: bring it out piece by piece: let no lot fall upon it. 

###### 7 
For her blood is in the midst of her: she set it upon an high rock, _and_ poured it not upon the ground to cover it with dust, 

###### 8 
That it might cause wrath to arise, and take vengeance: _even_ I have set her blood upon an high rock that it should not be covered. 

###### 9 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Woe to the bloody city, for I will make the burning great. 

###### 10 
Heap on much wood: kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and cast in spice, and let the bones be burnt. 

###### 11 
Then set it empty upon the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, _and_ that the scum of it may be consumed. 

###### 12 
She hath wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not out of her: _therefore_ her scum _shall be consumed_ with fire. 

###### 13 
_Thou remainest_ in thy filthiness _and_ wickedness: because I would have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness, till I have caused my wrath to light upon thee. 

###### 14 
I the Lord have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent: according to thy ways, and according to thy works shall they judge thee, saith the Lord God. 

###### 15 
¶ Also the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 16 
Son of man, behold, I take away from thee the pleasure of thine eyes with a plague: yet shalt thou neither mourn nor weep, neither shall thy tears run down. 

###### 17 
Cease from sighing: make no mourning for the dead, _and_ bind the tire of thine head upon thee, and put on thy shoes upon thy feet, _and_ cover not thy lips, and eat not the bread of men. 

###### 18 
So I spake unto the people in the morning, and at even my wife died: and I did in the morning, as I was commanded. 

###### 19 
And the people said unto me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things mean toward us that thou doest so? 

###### 20 
Then I answered them, The word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 21 
Speak unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, behold, I will pollute my Sanctuary, _even_ the pride of your power, the pleasure of your eyes, and your heart's desire, and your sons, and your daughters whom ye have left, shall fall by the sword. 

###### 22 
And ye shall do as I have done: ye shall not cover your lips, neither shall ye eat the bread of men. 

###### 23 
And your tire _shall be_ upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet: ye shall not mourn nor weep, but ye shall pine away for your iniquities, and mourn one toward another. 

###### 24 
Thus Ezekiel is unto you a sign: according to all that he hath done, ye shall do: and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord God. 

###### 25 
Also, thou son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their power, the joy of their honor, the pleasure of their eyes, and the desire of their heart, their sons and their daughters, 

###### 26 
That he that escapeth in that day, shall come unto thee _to tell thee_ that which he hath heard with _his_ ears? 

###### 27 
In that day shall thy mouth be opened to him which is escaped, and thou shalt speak, and be no more dumb, and thou shalt be a sign unto them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.
