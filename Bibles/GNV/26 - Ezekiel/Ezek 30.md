###### 1 
The word of the Lord came again unto me, saying, 

###### 2 
Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord God, Howl _and cry_, Woe _be_ unto this day. 

###### 3 
For the day is near, and the day of the Lord is at hand, a cloudy day, _and_ it shall be the time of the heathen. 

###### 4 
And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and fear shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, when they shall take away her multitude, and _when_ her foundations shall be broken down. 

###### 5 
Ethiopia and Put, and Lud, and all the common people, and Chub, and the men of the land, that is in league, shall fall with them by the sword. 

###### 6 
Thus saith the Lord, They also that maintain Egypt, shall fall, and the pride of her power shall come down: from the tower of Syene shall they fall by the sword, saith the Lord God. 

###### 7 
And they shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that are desolate, and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities that are wasted. 

###### 8 
And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have set a fire in Egypt, _and when_ all her helpers shall be destroyed. 

###### 9 
In that day shall there messengers go forth from me in ships, to make the careless Moors afraid, and fear shall come upon them, as in the day of Egypt: for lo, it cometh. 

###### 10 
Thus saith the Lord God, I will also make the multitude of Egypt to cease by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel. 

###### 11 
For he and his people with him, _even_ the terrible nations shall be brought to destroy the land: and they shall draw their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain. 

###### 12 
And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hands of the wicked, and I will make the land waste, and all that therein is by the hands of strangers: I the Lord have spoken it. 

###### 13 
Thus saith the Lord God, I will also destroy the idols, and I will cause their idols to cease out of Noph, and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt, and I will send a fear in the land of Egypt. 

###### 14 
And I will make Pathros desolate, and will set fire in Zoan, and I will execute judgment in No. 

###### 15 
And I will pour my wrath upon Sin, _which is_ the strength of Egypt: and I will destroy the multitude of No. 

###### 16 
And I will set fire in Egypt: Sin shall have great sorrow, and No shall be destroyed, and Noph shall have sorrows daily. 

###### 17 
The young men of Aven, and of Pi Beseth shall fall by the sword: and these _cities_ shall go into captivity. 

###### 18 
At Tehaphnehes the day shall restrain _his light_, when I shall break there the bars of Egypt: and when the pomp of her power shall cease in her, the cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall go into captivity. 

###### 19 
Thus will I execute judgments in Egypt, and they shall know that I am the Lord. 

###### 20 
¶ And in the eleventh year, in the first _month, and_ in the seventh _day_ of the month, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 21 
Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt: and lo, it shall not be bound up to be healed, neither shall they put a roll to bind it, and _so_ make it strong to hold the sword. 

###### 22 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, I _come_ against Pharaoh King of Egypt, and will break his arm that was strong, but is broken, and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand. 

###### 23 
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse them through the countries. 

###### 24 
And I will strengthen the arm of the king of Babel, and put my sword in his hand, but I will break Pharaoh's arms, and he shall cast out sighings, as the sighings of him that is wounded before him. 

###### 25 
But I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babel, and the arms of Pharaoh shall fall down, and they shall know, that I am the Lord, when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babel, and he shall stretch it out upon the land of Egypt. 

###### 26 
And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them among the countries, and they shall know, that I am the Lord.
