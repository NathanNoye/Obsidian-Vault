###### 1 
In the five and twentieth year of our being in captivity, in the beginning of the year, in the tenth _day_ of the month, in the fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the selfsame day, the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me thither. 

###### 2 
Into the land of Israel brought he me by a divine vision, and set me upon a very high mountain, whereupon _was_ as the building of a city, toward the South. 

###### 3 
And he brought me thither, and behold, there _was_ a man, whose similitude was to look to, like brass, with a linen thread in his hand, and a reed to measure with: and he stood at the gate. 

###### 4 
And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I shall show thee: for to the intent that they might be showed thee, art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest unto the house of Israel. 

###### 5 
And behold, _I saw_ a wall on the outside of the house round about: and in the man's hand _was_ a reed to measure with, of six cubits long, by the cubit, and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the building with one reed, and the height with one reed. 

###### 6 
Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the East, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the post of the gate, _which was_ one reed broad, and the other post of the gate, _which was_ one reed broad. 

###### 7 
And _every_ chamber was one reed long, and one reed broad, and between the chambers _were_ five cubits: and the post of the gate by the porch of the gate within _was_ one reed. 

###### 8 
He measured also the porch of the gate within with one reed. 

###### 9 
Then measured he the porch of the gate of eight cubits and the posts thereof, of two cubits, and the porch of the gate _was_ inward. 

###### 10 
And the Chambers of the gate Eastward, _were_ three on this side, and three on that side: they three _were_ of one measure, and the posts had one measure on this side, and one on that side. 

###### 11 
And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate ten cubits, _and_ the height of the gate thirteen cubits. 

###### 12 
The space also before the chambers _was_ one cubit _on this side_ and the space _was_ one cubit on that side, and the chambers _were_ six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side. 

###### 13 
He measured then the gate from the roof of a chamber to the top of the _gate_: the breadth _was_ five and twenty cubits, door against door. 

###### 14 
He made also posts of threescore cubits, and the posts of the court, _and_ of the gate, _had one measure_ round about. 

###### 15 
And upon the forefront of the entry of the gate unto the forefront of the porch of the gate within _were_ fifty cubits. 

###### 16 
And _there were_ narrow windows in the chambers, and in their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches: and the windows _went_ round about within: and upon the posts _were_ palm trees. 

###### 17 
¶ Then brought he me into the outward court, and lo, _there were_ chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about, _and_ thirty chambers _were_ upon the pavement. 

###### 18 
And the pavement _was_ by the side of the gates over against the length of the gates, _and_ the pavement _was_ beneath. 

###### 19 
Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate without, unto the forefront of the court within, an hundred cubits Eastward and Northward. 

###### 20 
And the gate of the outward court, that looked toward the North, measured he after the length and breadth thereof. 

###### 21 
And the chambers thereof _were_ three on this side, and three on that side, and the posts thereof and the arches thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length thereof _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 

###### 22 
And their windows, and their arches with their palm trees, _were_ after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the East, and the going up unto it _had_ seven steps, and the arches thereof _were_ before them. 

###### 23 
And the gate of the inner court _stood_ over against the gate toward the North, and toward the East, and he measured from gate to gate an hundred cubits. 

###### 24 
After that, he brought me toward the South, and lo, _there was_ a gate toward the South, and he measured the posts thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures. 

###### 25 
And _there were_ windows in it, and in the arches thereof round about, like those windows: the height _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 

###### 26 
And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof _were_ before them, and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side upon the post thereof. 

###### 27 
¶ And _there was_ a gate in the inner court toward the South, and he measured from gate to gate toward the South an hundred cubits. 

###### 28 
And he brought me into the inner court by the South gate, and he measured the South gate, according to these measures, 

###### 29 
And the chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof according to these measures, and _there were_ windows in it, and in the arches thereof round about, _it was_ fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 

###### 30 
And the arches round about _were_ five and twenty cubits long, and five cubits broad. 

###### 31 
And the arches thereof _were_ toward the utter Court, and palm trees _were_ upon the posts thereof, and the going up to it _had_ eight steps. 

###### 32 
¶ Again he brought me into the inner court toward the East, and he measured the gate according to these measures. 

###### 33 
And the chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and the arches thereof were according to these measures, and _there were_ windows therein, and in the arches thereof round about_: it was_ fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad. 

###### 34 
And the arches thereof _were_ toward the utter court, and palm trees _were_ upon the posts thereof, on this side and on that side, and the going up to it _had_ eight steps. 

###### 35 
¶ After he brought me to the North gate, and measured it, according to these measures, 

###### 36 
The chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches thereof, and _there were_ windows therein round about: the height _was_ fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. 

###### 37 
And the posts thereof _were_ toward the utter court, and palm trees _were_ upon the posts thereof on this side, and on that side, and the going up to it _had_ eight steps. 

###### 38 
And _every_ chamber, and the entry thereof _was_ under the posts of the gates: there they washed the burnt offering. 

###### 39 
And in the porch of the gate _stood_ two tables on this side, and two tables on that side, upon the which they slew the burnt offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering. 

###### 40 
And at the side beyond the steps, at the entry of the North gate _stood_ two tables, and on the other side, which was at the porch of the gate _were_ two tables. 

###### 41 
Four tables _were_ on this side, and four tables on that side by the side of the gate _even_ eight tables whereupon they slew _their sacrifice_. 

###### 42 
And the four tables _were_ of hewn stone for the burnt offering, of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad, and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice. 

###### 43 
And within _were_ borders an hand broad, fastened round about, and upon the tables _lay_ the flesh of the offering. 

###### 44 
And without the inner gate _were_ the chambers of the singers in the inner court, which was at the side of the North gate: and their prospect _was_ toward the South, and one _was_ at the side of the East gate, having the prospect toward the North. 

###### 45 
And he said unto me, This chamber whose prospect is toward the South _is_ for the Priests, that have charge to keep the house. 

###### 46 
And the chamber whose prospect is toward the North, _is_ for the Priests that have the charge to keep the Altar: these are the sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which may come near to the Lord to minister unto him. 

###### 47 
So he measured the court an hundred cubits long, and an hundred cubits broad, _even_ four square: likewise the Altar _that was_ before the house. 

###### 48 
And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured the posts of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits on that side: and the breadth of the gate _was_ three cubits on this side, and three cubits on that side. 

###### 49 
The length of the porch _was_ twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and _he brought me_ by the steps whereby they went up to it, and _there were_ pillars by the posts, one on this side and another on that side.
