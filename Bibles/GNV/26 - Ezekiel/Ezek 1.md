###### 1 
It came to pass in the thirtieth year in the fourth _month, and_ in the fifth _day_ of the month (as I was among the captives by the river Chebar) that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of GOD. 

###### 2 
In the fifth _day_ of the month (which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity) 

###### 3 
The word of the Lord came unto Ezekiel the Priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chebar, where the hand of the Lord was upon him. 

###### 4 
And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the North, a great cloud and a fire wrapped about it, and a brightness _was_ about it, and in the midst thereof, _to wit_, in the midst of the fire _came out_ as the likeness of amber. 

###### 5 
Also out of the midst thereof _came_ the likeness of four beasts, and this was their form: they had the appearance of a man, 

###### 6 
And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings. 

###### 7 
And their feet _were_ straight feet, and the sole of their feet _was_ like the soles of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of bright brass. 

###### 8 
And the hands of a man _came out_ from under their wings in the four parts of them, and they four had their faces, and their wings. 

###### 9 
They where joined by their wings one to another, _and_ when they went forth, they returned not, _but_ every one went straight forward. 

###### 10 
And the similitude of their faces _was as_ the face of a man: and they four had the face of a lion on the right side, and they four had the face of a bullock on the left side: they four also had the face of an Eagle. 

###### 11 
Thus were their faces: but their wings _were_ spread out above: two _wings_ of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. 

###### 12 
And every one went straight forward: they went whither their spirit led them, _and_ they returned not when they went forth. 

###### 13 
The similitude also of the beasts, _and_ their appearance _was_ like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: _for the fire_ ran among the beasts, and the fire gave a glister, and out of the fire there went lightning. 

###### 14 
And the beasts ran, and returned like unto lightning. 

###### 15 
Now as I beheld the beasts, behold, a wheel _appeared_ upon the earth by the beasts, having four faces. 

###### 16 
The fashion of the wheels and their work _was_ like unto a Chrysolite: and they four had one form, and their fashion and their work _was_ as one wheel in _another_ wheel. 

###### 17 
When they went, they went upon their four sides, _and_ they returned not when they went. 

###### 18 
They had also rings, and height, and were _fearful_ to behold, and their rings were full of eyes, round about them four. 

###### 19 
And when the beasts went, the wheels went with them: and when the beasts were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up. 

###### 20 
Whither their spirit led them, they went, _and_ thither did the spirit of the wheels lead them, and the wheels were lifted up besides them: for the spirit of the beasts _was_ in the wheels. 

###### 21 
When the _beasts_ went, they went, and when they stood, they stood, and when they were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up besides them: for the spirit of the beasts _was_ in the wheels. 

###### 22 
And the similitude of the firmament upon the heads of the beasts _was_ wonderful, like unto crystal spread over their heads above. 

###### 23 
And under the firmament _were_ their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two which covered them, and every one had two which covered their bodies. 

###### 24 
And when they went forth, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, _and_ as the voice of the Almighty, _even_ the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: _even_ when they stood, they let down their wings. 

###### 25 
And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, _and_ had let down their wings. 

###### 26 
And above the firmament that was over their heads, _was_ the fashion of a throne like unto a Sapphire stone, and upon the similitude of the throne _was_ by appearance, as the similitude of a man above upon it. 

###### 27 
And I saw as the appearance of amber, _and_ as the similitude of fire round about within it to look too, even from his loins upward: and to look too, even from his loins downward, I saw as a likeness of fire, and brightness round about it. 

###### 28 
As the likeness of the bow, that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so _was_ the appearance of the light round about. 

###### 29 
This was the appearance of the similitude of the glory of the Lord: and when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one that spake.
