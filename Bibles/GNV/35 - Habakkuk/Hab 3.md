###### 1 
A prayer of Habakkuk the Prophet for the ignorances. 

###### 2 
O Lord, I have heard thy voice, _and_ was afraid: O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the people, in the midst of the years make it known: in wrath remember mercy. 

###### 3 
God cometh from Teman, and the holy One from mount Paran, Selah. His glory covereth the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise, 

###### 4 
And _his_ brightness was as the light: he had horns _coming_ out of his hands, _and_ there was the hiding of his power. 

###### 5 
Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth before his feet. 

###### 6 
He stood and measured the earth: he beheld and dissolved the nations, and the everlasting mountains were broken, _and_ the ancient hills did bow: his ways _are_ everlasting. 

###### 7 
For _his_ iniquity I saw the tents of Cushan, _and_ the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble. 

###### 8 
Was the Lord angry against the rivers? or was thine anger against the floods? or was thy wrath against the sea, that thou didst ride upon thine horses? thy chariots brought salvation. 

###### 9 
Thy bow was manifestly revealed, _and_ the oaths of the tribes _were_ a sure word, Selah, thou didst cleave the earth with rivers. 

###### 10 
The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the stream of the water passed by: the deep made a noise, and lifted up his hand on high. 

###### 11 
The sun _and_ moon stood still in _their_ habitation: at the light of thine arrows they went, _and_ at the bright shining of thy spears. 

###### 12 
Thou trodest down the land in anger, _and_ didst thresh the heathen in displeasure. 

###### 13 
Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, _even_ for salvation with thine Anointed: thou hast wounded the head of the house of the wicked, and discoveredst the foundations unto the neck, Selah. 

###### 14 
Thou didst strike through with his own staves the heads of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing _was_ as to devour the poor secretly. 

###### 15 
Thou didst walk in the sea with thine horses upon the heap of great waters. 

###### 16 
When I heard, my belly trembled: my lips shook at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: _for_ when he cometh up unto the people, he shall destroy them. 

###### 17 
For the fig tree shall not flourish, neither shall fruit _be_ in the vines: the labor of the olive shall fail, and the fields shall yield no meat: the sheep shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no bullock in the stalls. 

###### 18 
But I will rejoice in the Lord: I will joy in the God of my salvation. 

###### 19 
The Lord God _is_ my strength: he will make my feet like hinds' _feet_, and he will make me to walk upon mine high places. To the chief singer on Neginoth.
