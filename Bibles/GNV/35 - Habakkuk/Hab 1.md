###### 1 
The burden, which Habakkuk the Prophet did see. 

###### 2 
O Lord, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! _even_ cry out unto thee for violence, and thou wilt not help! 

###### 3 
Why dost thou show me iniquity, and cause me to behold sorrow? for spoiling, and violence _are_ before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention. 

###### 4 
Therefore the Law is dissolved, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous: therefore wrong judgment proceedeth. 

###### 5 
Behold among the heathen, and regard, and wonder, _and_ marvel: for I will work a work in your days: ye will not believe it, though it be told you. 

###### 6 
For lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and furious nation, which shall go upon the breadth of the land to possess the dwelling places _that are_ not theirs. 

###### 7 
They are terrible and fearful: their judgment, and their dignity shall proceed of themselves. 

###### 8 
Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the wolves in the evening: and their horsemen are many: and their horsemen shall come from far: they shall fly as the eagle hasting to meat. 

###### 9 
They come all to spoil: for their faces _shall be_ an East wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand. 

###### 10 
And they shall mock the Kings, and the princes _shall be_ a scorn unto them: they shall deride every stronghold: for they shall gather dust, and take it. 

###### 11 
Then shall they take a courage, and transgress and do wickedly, _imputing_ this their power unto their god. 

###### 12 
Art not thou of old, O Lord my God, mine holy One? we shall not die: O Lord, thou hast ordained them for judgment, and O God, thou hast established them for correction. 

###### 13 
_Thou art_ of pure eyes, and canst not see evil: thou canst not behold wickedness: wherefore dost thou look upon the transgressors, _and_ holdest thy tongue, when the wicked devoureth the man, that is more righteous than he? 

###### 14 
And makest men as the fishes of the sea, _and_ as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them? 

###### 15 
They take up all with the angle: they catch it in their net, and gather it in their yarn, whereof they rejoice and are glad. 

###### 16 
Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their yarn, because by them their portion _is_ fat, and their meat plenteous. 

###### 17 
Shall they therefore stretch out their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?
