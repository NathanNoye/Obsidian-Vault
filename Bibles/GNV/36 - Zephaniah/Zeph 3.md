###### 1 
Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the robbing city. 

###### 2 
She heard not the voice: she received not correction: she trusted not in the Lord: she drew not near to her God. 

###### 3 
Her princes within her _are_ as roaring lions: her judges _are_ as wolves in the evening, _which_ leave not the bones till the morrow. 

###### 4 
Her prophets are light, _and_ wicked persons: her priests have polluted the Sanctuary: they have wrested the Law. 

###### 5 
The just Lord _is_ in the midst thereof: he will do none iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light, he faileth not: but the wicked will not learn to be ashamed. 

###### 6 
I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate: I have made their streets waste, that none shall pass by, their cities are destroyed without man, _and_ without inhabitant. 

###### 7 
I said, surely thou wilt fear me: thou wilt receive instruction: so their dwelling should not be destroyed howsoever I visited them, but they rose early, _and_ corrupted all their works. 

###### 8 
Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the day that I rise up to the prey: for I am determined to gather the nations, and that I will assemble the kingdoms to pour upon them mine indignation, _even_ all my fierce wrath: for all the earth shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy. 

###### 9 
Surely then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent. 

###### 10 
From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, the daughter of my dispersed, praying unto me, shall bring me an offering. 

###### 11 
In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy works, wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then will I take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice of thy pride, and thou shalt no more be proud of mine holy mountain. 

###### 12 
Then will I leave in the midst of thee an humble and poor people: and they shall trust in the Name of the Lord. 

###### 13 
The remnant of Israel shall do none iniquity, nor speak lies: neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for they shall be fed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid. 

###### 14 
Rejoice, O daughter Zion: be ye joyful, O Israel: be glad and rejoice with all _thine_ heart, O daughter Jerusalem. 

###### 15 
The Lord hath taken away thy judgments: he hath cast out thine enemy: the king of Israel, _even_ the Lord _is_ in the midst of thee: thou shalt see no more evil. 

###### 16 
In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not, O Zion, let not thine hands be faint. 

###### 17 
The Lord thy God in the midst of thee _is_ mighty: he will save, he will rejoice over thee with joy: he will quiet himself in his love: he will rejoice over thee with joy. 

###### 18 
After a certain time will I gather the afflicted that were of thee, _and_ them that bare the reproach for it. 

###### 19 
Behold, at that time I will bruise all that afflict thee, and I will save her that halteth, and gather her that was cast out, and I will get them praise and fame in all the lands of their shame. 

###### 20 
At that time will I bring you again, and then will I gather you: for I will give you a name and a praise among all people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.
