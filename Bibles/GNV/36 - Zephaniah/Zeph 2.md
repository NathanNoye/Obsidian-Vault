###### 1 
Gather yourselves, even gather you, O nation not worthy to be loved, 

###### 2 
Before the decree come forth, _and ye be_ as chaff that passeth in a day, _and_ before the fierce wrath of the Lord come upon you, _and_ before the day of the Lord's anger come upon you. 

###### 3 
Seek ye the Lord all the meek of the earth, which have wrought his judgment: seek righteousness, seek lowliness, if so be that ye may be hid in the day of the Lord's wrath. 

###### 4 
For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon desolate: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up. 

###### 5 
[Woe] unto the inhabitants of the sea coast. the nation of the Cherethims, the word of the Lord is against you: O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee without an inhabitant. 

###### 6 
And the sea coast shall be dwellings _and_ cottages for shepherds and sheepfolds. 

###### 7 
And _that_ coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah, to feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall they judge toward night: for the Lord their God shall visit them, and turn away their captivity. 

###### 8 
I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the rebukes of the children of Ammon, whereby they upbraided my people, and magnified themselves against their borders. 

###### 9 
Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of Ammon as Gomorrah, _even_ the breeding of nettles, and salt pits, and a perpetual desolation, the residue of my folk shall spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them. 

###### 10 
This shall they have for their pride, because they have reproached, and magnified themselves against the Lord of host's people. 

###### 11 
The Lord _will be_ terrible unto them: for he will consume all the gods of the earth, and every man shall worship him from his place, _even_ all the isles of the heathen. 

###### 12 
Ye Morians also shall be slain by my sword with them. 

###### 13 
And he will stretch out his hand against the North, and destroy Assyria, and will make Nineveh desolate, _and_ waste like a wilderness. 

###### 14 
And flocks shall lie in the midst of her, and all the beasts of the nations, and the pelican and the owl shall abide in the upper posts of it: the voice _of birds_ shall sing in the windows, _and_ desolations _shall be_ upon the posts: for the cedars are uncovered. 

###### 15 
This is the rejoicing city that dwelt careless, that said in her heart, I am, and there _is_ none besides me: how is she made waste, and the lodging of the beasts! everyone that passeth by her shall hiss and wag his hand.
