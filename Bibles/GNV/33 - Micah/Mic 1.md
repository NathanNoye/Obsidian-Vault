###### 1 
The word of the Lord, that came unto Micah the Moreshite in the days of Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah kings of Judah, which he saw concerning Samaria, and Jerusalem. 

###### 2 
Hear, all ye people: hearken thou, O earth, and all that therein is, and let the Lord God be witness against you, _even_ the Lord from his holy Temple. 

###### 3 
For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place, and will come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth. 

###### 4 
And the mountains shall melt under him (so shall the valleys cleave) as wax before the fire, _and_ as the waters that are poured downward. 

###### 5 
For the wickedness of Jacob _is_ all this, and for the sins of the house of Israel: what is the wickedness of Jacob? Is not Samaria? and which are the high places of Judah? Is not Jerusalem? 

###### 6 
Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, _and_ for the planting of a vineyard, and I will cause the stones thereof to tumble down into the valley, and I will discover the foundations thereof. 

###### 7 
And all the graven images thereof shall be broken, and all the gifts thereof shall be burnt with the fire, and all the idols thereof will I destroy: for she gathered it of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the wages of an harlot. 

###### 8 
Therefore I will mourn and howl: I will go without clothes, and naked: I will make lamentation like the dragons, and mourning as the ostriches. 

###### 9 
For her plagues are grievous: for it is come into Judah: _the enemy_ is come unto the gate of my people, unto Jerusalem. 

###### 10 
Declare ye it not at Gath, neither weep ye: for the house of Aphrah roll thyself in the dust. 

###### 11 
Thou that dwellest at Shaphir, go together naked with shame: she that dwelleth at Zaanan, shall not come forth in the mourning of Beth Ezel: _the enemy_ shall receive of you for his standing. 

###### 12 
For the inhabitant of Maroth waited for good, but evil came from the Lord unto the gate of Jerusalem. 

###### 13 
O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the _beasts_ of price: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee. 

###### 14 
Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moresheth Gath: the houses of Achzib _shall be_ as a lie to the kings of Israel. 

###### 15 
Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah, he shall come unto Adullam, the glory of Israel. 

###### 16 
Make thee bald: and shave thee for thy delicate children: enlarge thy baldness as the eagle, for they are gone into captivity from thee.
