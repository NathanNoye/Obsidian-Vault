###### 1 
Hearken ye now what the Lord saith, Arise thou, _and_ contend _before_ the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. 

###### 2 
Hear ye, O mountains, the Lord's quarrel, and ye mighty foundations of the earth: for the Lord hath a quarrel against his people, and he will plead with Israel. 

###### 3 
O my people, what have I done unto thee? or wherein have I grieved thee? testify against me. 

###### 4 
Surely I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants, and I have sent before thee, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam. 

###### 5 
O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab had devised, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him, from Shittim unto Gilgal, that ye may know the righteousness of the Lord. 

###### 6 
Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, _and_ bow myself before the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings, _and_ with calves of a year old? 

###### 7 
Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, _even_ the fruit of my body, for the sin of my soul? 

###### 8 
He hath showed thee, O man, what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee: surely to do justly, and to love mercy, and to humble thyself, to walk with thy God. 

###### 9 
The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: Hear the rod, and who hath appointed it. 

###### 10 
Are yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure, that is abominable? 

###### 11 
Shall I justify the wicked balances, and the bag of deceitful weights? 

###### 12 
For the rich men thereof are full of cruelty, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue _is_ deceitful in their mouth. 

###### 13 
Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, _and_ in making _thee_ desolate, because of thy sins. 

###### 14 
Thou shalt eat and not be satisfied, and thy casting down _shall be_ in the midst of thee, and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver, and that which thou deliverest, will I give up to the sword. 

###### 15 
Thou shalt sow, but not reap: Thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil, and _make_ sweet wine, but shall not drink wine. 

###### 16 
For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the manner of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels, that I should make thee waste, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.
