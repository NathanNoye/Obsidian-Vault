###### 1 
Woe is me, for I am as the Summer gatherings, _and _as the grapes of the vintage: there _is_ no cluster to eat: my soul desired the first ripe fruits. 

###### 2 
The good man is perished out of the earth, and there _is_ none righteous among men: they all lie in wait for blood: every man hunteth his brother with a net. 

###### 3 
To make good for the evil of _their_ hands, the prince asked, and the judge _judgeth_ for a reward: therefore the great man he speaketh out the corruption of his soul: so they wrapped it up. 

###### 4 
The best of them _is_ as a brier, and the most righteous of them _is sharper_ than a thorn-hedge: the day of thy watchmen _and_ thy visitation cometh: then shall be their confusion. 

###### 5 
Trust ye not in a friend, neither put ye confidence in a counselor: keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom. 

###### 6 
For the son revileth the father: the daughter riseth up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, _and_ a man's enemies _are_ the men of his own house. 

###### 7 
Therefore I will look unto the Lord: I will wait for God my Savior: my God will hear me. 

###### 8 
Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: though I fall, I shall arise, when I shall sit in darkness, the Lord _shall be_ a light unto me. 

###### 9 
I will bear the wrath of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for me: _then_ will he bring me forth to the light, _and_ I shall see his righteousness. 

###### 10 
Then she that is mine enemy, shall look upon it, and shame shall cover her, which said unto me, Where is the Lord thy God? Mine eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the mire of the streets. 

###### 11 
_This is_ the day, that thy walls shall be built: this day shall drive far away the decree. 

###### 12 
In this day also they shall come unto thee from Assyria, and _from_ the strong cities, and from the strongholds even unto the river, and from Sea to Sea, and from mountain to mountain. 

###### 13 
Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them that dwell therein, _and_ for the fruits of their inventions. 

###### 14 
Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage (which dwell solitary in the wood) _as_ in the midst of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in old time. 

###### 15 
According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt, will I show unto him marvelous things. 

###### 16 
The nations shall see, and be confounded for all their power: they shall lay their hand upon their mouth: their ears shall be deaf. 

###### 17 
They shall lick the dust like a serpent: they shall move out of their holes like worms: they shall be afraid of the Lord our God, and shall fear because of thee. 

###### 18 
Who is a God like unto thee, that taketh away iniquity, and passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage! He retaineth not his wrath forever, because mercy pleaseth him. 

###### 19 
He will turn again, _and_ have compassion upon us: he will subdue our iniquities, and cast all their sins into the bottom of the sea. 

###### 20 
Thou wilt perform _thy_ truth to Jacob, _and_ mercy to Abraham, as thou hast sworn unto our fathers in old time.
