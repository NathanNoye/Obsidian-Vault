###### 1 
And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel: should not ye know judgment? 

###### 2 
_But_ they hate the good, and love the evil: they pluck off their skins from them, and their flesh from their bones. 

###### 3 
And they eat also the flesh of my people, and flay off their skin from them, and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron. 

###### 4 
Then shall they cry unto the Lord, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, because they have done wickedly in their works. 

###### 5 
Thus saith the Lord, Concerning the prophets that deceive my people, and bite them with their teeth, and cry, peace, but if a man put not into their mouths, they prepare war against him. 

###### 6 
Therefore night shall be unto you for a vision, and darkness _shall be_ unto you for a divination, and the Sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them. 

###### 7 
Then shall the Seers be ashamed, and the Soothsayers confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips, for they have none answer of God. 

###### 8 
Yet notwithstanding I am full of power by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of strength to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin. 

###### 9 
Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel: they abhor judgment, and pervert all equity. 

###### 10 
They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity, 

###### 11 
The heads thereof judge for rewards, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof prophesy for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord and say, Is not the Lord among us? no evil can come upon us. 

###### 12 
Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed _as_ a field, and Jerusalem shall be an heap, and the mountain of the house, as the high places of the forest.
