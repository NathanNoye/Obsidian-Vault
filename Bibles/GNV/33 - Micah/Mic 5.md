###### 1 
Now assemble thy garrisons, O daughter of garrisons: he hath laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. 

###### 2 
And thou Bethlehem Ephrathah art little to be among the thousands of Judah, _yet_ out of thee shall he come forth unto me, that shall be the ruler in Israel: whose goings forth _have been_ from the beginning _and_ from everlasting. 

###### 3 
Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which shall bear, shall travail: then the remnant of their brethren shall return unto the children of Israel. 

###### 4 
And he shall stand, and feed in the strength of the Lord, _and_ in the majesty of the Name of the Lord his God, and they shall dwell still: for now shall he be magnified unto the ends of the world. 

###### 5 
And he shall be _our_ peace when Assyria shall come into our land: when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight principal men. 

###### 6 
And they shall destroy Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod with their swords: thus shall he deliver _us_ from Assyria, when he cometh into our land, and when he shall tread within our borders. 

###### 7 
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among many people, as a dew from the Lord, _and_ as the showers upon the grass, that waiteth not for man, nor hopeth in the sons of Adam. 

###### 8 
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many people, as the Lion among the beasts of the forest, _and_ as the Lion whelp among the flocks of sheep, who when he goeth through, treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver. 

###### 9 
Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all thine enemies shall be cut off. 

###### 10 
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that I will cut off thine horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots. 

###### 11 
And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and overthrow all thy strongholds. 

###### 12 
And I will cut off thine enchanters out of thine hand: and thou shalt have no more soothsayers. 

###### 13 
Thine idols also will I cut off, and thine images out of the midst of thee: and thou shalt no more worship the work of thine hands. 

###### 14 
And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so will I destroy thine enemies. 

###### 15 
And I will execute a vengeance in _my_ wrath and indignation upon the heathen, which they have not heard.
