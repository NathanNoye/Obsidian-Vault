###### 1 
After this now, David smote the Philistines and subdued them, and David took the bridle of bondage out of the hand of the Philistines. 

###### 2 
And he smote Moab, and measured them with a cord, and cast them down to the ground: he measured them with two cords to put them to death, and with one full cord to keep them alive: so became the Moabites David's servants, and brought gifts. 

###### 3 
¶ David smote also Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates. 

###### 4 
And David took of them a thousand and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen, and David destroyed all the chariots, but he reserved an hundred chariots of them. 

###### 5 
¶ Then came the Aramites of Dammesek to succor Hadadezer king of Zobah, but David slew of the Aramites two and twenty thousand men. 

###### 6 
And David put a garrison in Aram of Dammesek: and the Aramites became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the Lord saved David wheresoever he went. 

###### 7 
And David took the shields of gold that belonged to the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 

###### 8 
And out of Betah, and Berothai (cities of Hadadezer) king David brought exceedingly much brass. 

###### 9 
¶ Then Toi king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer, 

###### 10 
Therefore Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to rejoice with him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and beaten him (for Hadadezer had war with Toi) who brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass. 

###### 11 
And king David dedicated them unto the Lord with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all the nations, which he had subdued: 

###### 12 
Of Aram, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob king of Zobah. 

###### 13 
So David got a name after that he returned, and had slain of the Aramites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand men. 

###### 14 
And he put a garrison in Edom: throughout all Edom put he soldiers, and all they of Edom became David's servants: and the Lord kept David whithersoever he went. 

###### 15 
Thus David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice unto all his people. 

###### 16 
And Joab the son of Zeruiah _was_ over the host, and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was Recorder. 

###### 17 
And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar _were_ the Priests, and Seraiah the Scribe. 

###### 18 
And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and David's sons were chief rulers.
