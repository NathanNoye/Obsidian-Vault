###### 1 
Afterward when the King sat in his house, and the Lord had given him rest round about from all his enemies, 

###### 2 
The King said unto Nathan the Prophet, Behold, now I dwell in an house of cedar trees, and the Ark of God remaineth within the curtains. 

###### 3 
Then Nathan said unto the king, Go, and do all that is in thine heart: for the Lord _is_ with thee. 

###### 4 
¶ And the same night the word of the Lord came unto Nathan, saying, 

###### 5 
Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the Lord, Shalt thou build me an house for my dwelling? 

###### 6 
For I have dwelt in no house since the time that I brought the children of Israel out of Egypt unto this day, but have walked in a tent and Tabernacle. 

###### 7 
In all the _places_ wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel, spake I one word with any of the tribes of Israel when I commanded _the Judges_ to feed my people Israel? or said I, Why build ye not me an house of cedar trees? 

###### 8 
Now therefore so say unto my servant David, Thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote following the sheep, that thou mightest be ruler over my people, over Israel. 

###### 9 
And I was with thee wheresoever thou hast walked, and have destroyed all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth. 

###### 10 
(Also I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant it, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more, neither shall wicked people trouble them anymore as beforetime, 

###### 11 
And since the time that I set Judges over my people of Israel) and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies: also the Lord telleth thee, that he will make thee an house. 

###### 12 
And when thy days be fulfilled, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy body, and will establish his kingdom. 

###### 13 
He shall build an house for my Name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 

###### 14 
I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and if he sin, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the plagues of the children of men. 

###### 15 
But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul whom I have put away before thee. 

###### 16 
And thine house shall be established and thy kingdom forever before thee, _even_ thy throne shall be established forever. 

###### 17 
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, Nathan spake thus unto David. 

###### 18 
¶ Then King David went in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord God, and what is mine house, that thou hast brought me hitherto? 

###### 19 
And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord God, therefore thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while: but doth this appertain to man, O Lord God? 

###### 20 
And what can David say more unto thee? for thou, Lord God, knowest thy servant. 

###### 21 
For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart hast thou done all these great things, to make them known unto thy servant. 

###### 22 
Wherefore thou art great, O Lord God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God besides thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 

###### 23 
And what one people in the earth is like thy people, like Israel? whose God went and redeemed them to himself, that they might be his people, and that he might make him a name, and do for you great things, and terrible for thy land, O Lord, _even_ for thy people, whom thou redeemedst to thee out of Egypt, _from_ the nations, and their gods? 

###### 24 
For thou hast ordained to thyself thy people Israel to be thy people forever: and thou Lord art become their God. 

###### 25 
Now therefore, O Lord God, confirm forever the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house, and do as thou hast said. 

###### 26 
And let thy Name be magnified forever by them that shall say, The Lord of hosts _is_ the God over Israel, and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee. 

###### 27 
For thou, O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed unto thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant been bold to pray this prayer unto thee. 

###### 28 
Therefore now, O Lord God, (_for_ thou art God, and thy words be true, and thou hast told this goodness unto thy servant.) 

###### 29 
Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue forever before thee: for thou, O Lord God, hast spoken it: and let the house of thy servant be blessed forever with thy blessing.
