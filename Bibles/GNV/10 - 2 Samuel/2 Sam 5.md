###### 1 
Then came all the tribes of Israel to David unto Hebron, and said thus, Behold, we are thy bones and thy flesh. 

###### 2 
And in time past when Saul was our King, thou leddest Israel in and out: and the Lord hath said to thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be a captain over Israel. 

###### 3 
So all the Elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron: and King David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the Lord, and they anointed David King over Israel. 

###### 4 
¶ David _was_ thirty years old when he began to reign: _and_ he reigned forty years. 

###### 5 
In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years, and six months: and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty and three years over all Israel and Judah. 

###### 6 
¶ The King also and his men went to Jerusalem unto the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land: who spake unto David, saying, Except thou take away the blind and the lame, thou shalt not come in hither: thinking that David could not come thither: 

###### 7 
But David took the fort of Zion: this is the city of David. 

###### 8 
Now David had said the same day, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites, and getteth up to the gutters and _smiteth_ the lame and blind, which David's soul hateth, _I will prefer him_: therefore they said, The blind and the lame shall not come into that house. 

###### 9 
So David dwelt in that fort, and called it the city of David, and David built round about it, from Millo, and inward. 

###### 10 
And David prospered and grew: for the Lord God of hosts _was_ with him. 

###### 11 
¶ Hiram also king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons for walls: and they built David an house. 

###### 12 
Then David knew that the Lord had established him King over Israel, and that he had exalted his kingdom for his people Israel's sake. 

###### 13 
And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron, and more sons and daughters were born to David. 

###### 14 
And these be the names of the sons, that were born unto him in Jerusalem, Shammua, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, 

###### 15 
And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Nepheg, and Japhia, 

###### 16 
And Elishama, and Eliada, and Eliphelet. 

###### 17 
¶ But when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel, all the Philistines came up to seek David: and when David heard, he went down to a fort. 

###### 18 
But the Philistines came, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 

###### 19 
Then David asked counsel of the Lord, saying, Shall I go up to the Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into mine hands? And the Lord answered David, Go up: for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hands. 

###### 20 
¶ Then David came to Baal Perazim, and smote them there, and said, The Lord hath divided mine enemies asunder before me, as waters be divided asunder: therefore he called the name of that place, Baal Perazim. 

###### 21 
And there they left their images, and David and his men burnt them. 

###### 22 
Again the Philistines came up, and spread themselves in the valley of Rephaim. 

###### 23 
And when David asked counsel of the Lord, he answered, Thou shalt not go up, _but_ turn about behind them, and come upon them over against the mulberry trees. 

###### 24 
And when thou hearest the noise of one going in the tops of the mulberry trees, then remove: for then shall the Lord go out before thee to smite the host of the Philistines. 

###### 25 
Then David did so as the Lord had commanded him, and smote the Philistines from Geba, until thou come to Gezer.
