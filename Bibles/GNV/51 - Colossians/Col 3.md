###### 1 
If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth at the right hand of God. 

###### 2 
Set your affections on things which are above, _and_ not on things which are on the earth. 

###### 3 
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God. 

###### 4 
When Christ which is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory. 

###### 5 
Mortify therefore your members which are on the earth, fornication, uncleanness, the inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness which is idolatry. 

###### 6 
For the which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience. 

###### 7 
Wherein ye also walked once, when ye lived in them. 

###### 8 
But now put ye away even all these things, wrath, anger, maliciousness, cursed speaking, filthy speaking, out of your mouth. 

###### 9 
Lie not one to another: seeing that ye have put off the old man with his works, 

###### 10 
And have put on the new, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him, 

###### 11 
Where is neither Grecian nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond, free: But Christ is all, and in all things. 

###### 12 
Now therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on the bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering: 

###### 13 
Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel to another: even as Christ forgave, even so do ye. 

###### 14 
And above all these things _put on_ love, which is the bond of perfectness. 

###### 15 
And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which ye are called in one body, and be ye thankful: 

###### 16 
Let the word of Christ dwell in you plenteously in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing your own selves, in Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with a grace in your hearts to the Lord, 

###### 17 
And whatsoever ye shall do, in word or deed, _do_ all in the Name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God even the Father by him. 

###### 18 
¶ Wives, submit yourselves unto your husbands, as it is comely in the Lord. 

###### 19 
Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter unto them. 

###### 20 
¶ Children, obey your parents in all things: for that is well pleasing unto the Lord. 

###### 21 
Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged. 

###### 22 
¶ Servants, be obedient unto them that are _your_ masters according to the flesh, in all things, not with eye service as men pleasers, but in singleness of heart, fearing God. 

###### 23 
And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not to men, 

###### 24 
Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ. 

###### 25 
But he that doeth wrong, shall receive for the wrong that he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
