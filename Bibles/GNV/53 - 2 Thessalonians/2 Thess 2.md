###### 1 
Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our assembling unto him, 

###### 2 
That ye be not suddenly moved from _your_ mind, nor troubled neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter, as _it were_ from us, as though the day of Christ were at hand. 

###### 3 
Let no man deceive you by any means: for _that day shall not come_, except there come a departing first, and that that man of sin be disclosed, _even_ the son of perdition. 

###### 4 
Which is an adversary, and exalteth himself against all that is called God, or that is worshipped: so that he doth sit as God in the Temple of God, showing himself that he is God. 

###### 5 
Remember ye not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things? 

###### 6 
And now ye know what withholdeth, that he might be revealed in his time. 

###### 7 
For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he which now withholdeth, _shall let_ till he be taken out of the way. 

###### 8 
And then shall that wicked man be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the Spirit of his mouth, and shall abolish with the brightness of his coming, 

###### 9 
_Even him_ whose coming is by the effectual working of Satan, with all power, and signs, and lying wonders, 

###### 10 
And in all deceivableness of unrighteousness, among them that perish, because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved. 

###### 11 
And therefore God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe lies, 

###### 12 
That all they might be damned which believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness. 

###### 13 
But we ought to give thanks always to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because that God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation, through sanctification of the Spirit, and the faith of truth, 

###### 14 
Whereunto he called you by our Gospel, to obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 15 
Therefore, brethren, stand fast and keep the instructions, which ye have been taught, either by word, or by our Epistle. 

###### 16 
Now the same Jesus Christ our Lord, and our God, even the Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace, 

###### 17 
Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every word and good work.
