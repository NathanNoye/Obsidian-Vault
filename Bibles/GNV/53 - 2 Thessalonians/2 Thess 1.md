###### 1 
Paul and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the Church of the Thessalonians, _which is_ in God our Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: 

###### 2 
Grace _be_ with you, and peace from God our Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 3 
We ought to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the love of every one of you toward another, aboundeth, 

###### 4 
So that we ourselves rejoice of you in the Churches of God, because of your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye suffer. 

###### 5 
_Which is_ a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for the which ye also suffer. 

###### 6 
For it is a righteous thing with God, to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you, 

###### 7 
And to you which are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall show himself from heaven with his mighty Angels, 

###### 8 
In flaming fire, rendering vengeance unto them, that do not know God, and which obey not unto the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 9 
Which shall be punished with everlasting perdition from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, 

###### 10 
When he shall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be made marvelous in all them that believe (because our testimony toward you was believed) in that day. 

###### 11 
Wherefore, we also pray always for you, that our God may make you worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good pleasure of _his_ goodness, and the work of faith with power. 

###### 12 
That the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God, and of the Lord Jesus Christ.
