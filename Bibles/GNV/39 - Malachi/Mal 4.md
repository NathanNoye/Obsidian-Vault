###### 1 
For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh, shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, and shall leave them neither root nor branch. 

###### 2 
But unto you that fear my name, shall the sun of righteousness arise, and health _shall be_ under his wings, and ye shall go forth and grow up as fat calves. 

###### 3 
And ye shall tread down the wicked: for they shall be dust under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do _this_, saith the Lord of hosts. 

###### 4 
Remember the Law of Moses my servant, which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments. 

###### 5 
Behold, I will send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the great and fearful day of the Lord. 

###### 6 
And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with cursing.
