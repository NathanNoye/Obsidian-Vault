###### 1 
And Jesus full of the holy Ghost returned from Jordan, and was led by that Spirit into the wilderness, 

###### 2 
And was _there_ forty days tempted of the devil, and in those days he did eat nothing, but when they were ended, he afterward was hungry. 

###### 3 
Then the devil said unto him, If thou be the son of God, command this stone, that it be made bread. 

###### 4 
But Jesus answered him, saying, **It is written, That man shall not live by bread only, but by every word of God.

###### 5 
Then the devil took him up into an high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, in the twinkling of an eye. 

###### 6 
And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of those _kingdoms_: for that is delivered to me: and to whomsoever I will, I give it. 

###### 7 
If thou therefore wilt worship me, they shall be all thine. 

###### 8 
But Jesus answered him, and said, **Hence from me, Satan: for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone thou shalt serve.

###### 9 
Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the Temple, and said unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down from hence, 

###### 10 
For it is written, That he will give his Angels charge over thee to keep thee: 

###### 11 
And with _their_ hands they shall lift thee up, lest at anytime thou shouldest dash thy foot against a stone. 

###### 12 
And Jesus answered, and said unto him, **It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.

###### 13 
And when the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a little season. 

###### 14 
¶ And Jesus returned by the power of the spirit into Galilee: and there went a fame of him throughout all the region round about: 

###### 15 
For he taught in their Synagogues, and was honored of all men. 

###### 16 
And he came to Nazareth where he had been brought up, and (as his custom was) went into the Synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. 

###### 17 
And there was delivered unto him the book of the Prophet Isaiah: and when he had opened the book, he found the place, where it was written, 

###### 18 
**The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me, that I should preach the Gospel to the poor: he hath sent me, that I should heal the brokenhearted, that I should preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, that I should set at liberty them that are bruised: The Bible (GNV) The Bible.md VBoxAudioTest VBoxAutostart VBoxBalloonCtrl VBoxBugReport VBoxHeadless VBoxManage VBoxVRDP VirtualBox VirtualBoxVM aws aws_completer bg2md.rb bg2obs.sh com.docker.cli contentful corepack docker docker-compose docker-compose-v1 docker-credential-desktop docker-credential-ecr-login docker-credential-osxkeychain firebase fuzzy_match httpclient hub-tool iloktool kubectl kubectl.docker locales n node npm npx pod sandbox-pod serverless sls tsc tsserver vbox-img vboximg-mount vpnkit xcodeproj

###### 20 
And he closed the book, and gave it again to the minister, and sat down: and the eyes of all that were in the Synagogue were fastened on him. 

###### 21 
Then he began to say unto them, **This day is the Scripture fulfilled in your ears.

###### 22 
And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words, which proceeded out of his mouth, and said, Is not this Joseph's son? 

###### 23 
Then he said unto them, **Ye will surely say unto me this Proverb, Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do it here likewise in thine own country.

**But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was shut three years and six months, when great famine was throughout all the land: The Bible (GNV) The Bible.md VBoxAudioTest VBoxAutostart VBoxBalloonCtrl VBoxBugReport VBoxHeadless VBoxManage VBoxVRDP VirtualBox VirtualBoxVM aws aws_completer bg2md.rb bg2obs.sh com.docker.cli contentful corepack docker docker-compose docker-compose-v1 docker-credential-desktop docker-credential-ecr-login docker-credential-osxkeychain firebase fuzzy_match httpclient hub-tool iloktool kubectl kubectl.docker locales n node npm npx pod sandbox-pod serverless sls tsc tsserver vbox-img vboximg-mount vpnkit xcodeproj

**But unto none of them was Elijah sent, save into Zarephath, **_**a city**_** of Sidon, unto a certain widow.

**Also many lepers were in Israel, in the time of Elisha the Prophet: yet none of them was made clean, saving Naaman the Syrian.

###### 28 
Then all _that were_ in the Synagogue, when they heard it, were filled with wrath, 

###### 29 
And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the edge of the hill, whereon their city was built, to cast him down headlong. 

###### 30 
But he passed through the midst of them, and went his way, 

###### 31 
¶ And came down into Capernaum a city of Galilee, and there taught them on the Sabbath days. 

###### 32 
And they were astonied at his doctrine: for his word was with authority. 

###### 33 
And in the Synagogue there was a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil, which cried with a loud voice, 

###### 34 
Saying, Oh, what have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, _even_ the Holy one of God. 

###### 35 
And Jesus rebuked him, saying, **Hold thy peace, and come out of him. **Then the devil throwing him in the midst _of them_, came out of him, and hurt him nothing at all. 

###### 36 
So fear came on them all, and they spake among themselves, saying, What thing is this: for with authority and power he commandeth the foul spirits, and they come out? 

###### 37 
And the fame of him spread abroad throughout all the places of the country round about. 

###### 38 
¶ And he rose up, and came out of the Synagogue, and entered into Simon's house. And Simon's wife's mother was taken with a great fever, and they required him for her. 

###### 39 
Then he stood over her, and rebuked the fever, and it left her, and immediately she arose, and ministered unto them. 

###### 40 
Now at the Sun setting, all they that had sick _folks_ of divers diseases, brought them unto him, and he laid his hands on everyone of them, and healed them. 

###### 41 
And devils also came out of many, crying, and saying, Thou art that Christ that Son of God: but he rebuked them, and suffered them not to say that they knew him to be that Christ. 

###### 42 
And when it was day, he departed, and went forth into a desert place, and the people sought him, and came to him, and kept him that he should not depart from them. 

###### 43 
But he said unto them, **Surely I must also preach the kingdom of God to other cities: for therefore am I sent.

###### 44 
And he preached in the Synagogues of Galilee.
