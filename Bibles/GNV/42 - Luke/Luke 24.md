###### 1 
Now the first _day_ of the week early in the morning, they came unto the sepulcher, and brought the odors which they had prepared, and certain _women_ with them. 

###### 2 
And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulcher, 

###### 3 
And went in, but found not the body of the Lord Jesus. 

###### 4 
And it came to pass, that as they were amazed thereat, behold, two men suddenly stood by them in shining vestures. 

###### 5 
And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye him that liveth, among the dead? 

###### 6 
He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you, when he was yet in Galilee, 

###### 7 
Saying, that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again. 

###### 8 
And they remembered his words, 

###### 9 
And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the remnant. 

###### 10 
Now it was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the _mother_ of James, and other women with them which told these things unto the Apostles. 

###### 11 
But their words seemed unto them as a feigned thing, neither believed they them. 

###### 12 
Then arose Peter and ran unto the sepulcher, and looked in and saw the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. 

###### 13 
¶ And behold two of them went that same day to a town which was from Jerusalem about threescore furlongs, called Emmaus. 

###### 14 
And they talked together of all these things that were done. 

###### 15 
And it came to pass, as they communed together, and reasoned, that Jesus himself drew near, and went with them. 

###### 16 
But their eyes were holden, that they could not know him. 

###### 17 
And he said unto them, **What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another as ye walk and are sad?

###### 18 
And the one (named Cleopas) answered and said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which are come to pass therein in these days? 

###### 19 
And he said unto them, **What things? **And they said unto him, Of Jesus of Nazareth, which was a Prophet, mighty indeed and in word before God, and all people, 

###### 20 
And how the high Priests, and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 

###### 21 
But we trusted that it had been he that should have delivered Israel, and as touching all these things, today is the third day, that they were done. 

###### 22 
Yea, and certain women among us made us astonied, which came early unto the sepulcher. 

###### 23 
And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of Angels, which said, that he was alive. 

###### 24 
Therefore certain of them which were with us, went to the sepulcher, and found it even so as the women had said, but him they saw not. 

###### 25 
Then he said unto them, **O fools and slow of heart to believe all that the Prophets have spoken!

###### 27 
And he began at Moses, and at all the Prophets, and interpreted unto them in all the Scriptures the things which were _written_ of him. 

###### 28 
And they drew near unto the town, which they went to, but he made as though he would have gone further. 

###### 29 
But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it is towards night, and the day is far spent. So he went in to tarry with them. 

###### 30 
And it came to pass, as he sat at table with them, he took the bread, and blessed, and brake it, and gave it to them. 

###### 31 
Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him: and he was no more seen of them. 

###### 32 
And they said between themselves, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and when he opened to us the Scriptures? 

###### 33 
And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 

###### 34 
Which said, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon. 

###### 35 
Then they told what things _were_ done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. 

###### 36 
¶ And as they spake these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said unto them, **Peace **_**be**_** to you.

###### 37 
But they were abashed and afraid, supposing that they had seen a spirit. 

###### 38 
Then he said unto them, **Why are ye troubled? and wherefore do doubts arise in your hearts?

###### 40 
And when he had thus spoken, he showed them _his_ hands and feet. 

###### 41 
And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, **Have ye here any meat?

###### 42 
And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb, 

###### 43 
And he took it, and did eat before them. 

###### 44 
And he said unto them, **These are the words, which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all must be fulfilled which are written of me in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms.

###### 45 
Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures,

###### 50 
Afterward he lead them out into Bethany, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 

###### 51 
And it came to pass, that as he blessed them, he departed from them, and was carried up into heaven. 

###### 52 
And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy, 

###### 53 
And were continually in the Temple, praising, and lauding God. Amen.
