###### 1 
And when Jabin king of Hazor had heard this, then he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 

###### 2 
And unto the kings that were by the North in the mountains and plains toward the South side of Chinneroth, and in the valleys, and in the borders of Dor Westward, 

###### 3 
_And_ unto the Canaanites, _both_ by East, and by West, and unto the Amorites, and Hittites, and Perizzites, and Jebusites in the mountains, and unto the Hivites, under Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 

###### 4 
And they came out, and all their hosts with them, many people, as the sand that is on the seashore, for multitude, with horses and chariots exceeding many. 

###### 5 
So all these kings met together, and came and pitched together at the waters of Merom, for to fight against Israel. 

###### 6 
¶ Then the Lord said unto Joshua, Be not afraid for them: for tomorrow about this time will I deliver them all slain before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their chariots with fire. 

###### 7 
Then came Joshua and all the men of war with him, against them, by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell upon them. 

###### 8 
And the Lord gave them into the hand of Israel: and they smote them, and chased them unto great Sidon, and unto Misrephoth, and unto the valley of Mizpah Eastward, and smote them until they had none remaining of them. 

###### 9 
And Joshua did unto them as the Lord bade him: he houghed their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire. 

###### 10 
¶ At that time also Joshua turned back, and took Hazor, and smote the King thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the head of all those kingdoms. 

###### 11 
Moreover they smote all the persons that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying _all_, leaving none alive, and he burnt Hazor with fire. 

###### 12 
So all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword, _and_ utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. 

###### 13 
But Israel burnt none of the cities that stood still in their strength, save Hazor only, that Joshua burnt. 

###### 14 
And all the spoil of these cities and the cattle, the children of Israel took for their prey, but they smote every man with the edge of the sword until they had destroyed them, not leaving one alive. 

###### 15 
¶ As the Lord had commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua, and so did Joshua, he left nothing undone of all that the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 16 
So Joshua took all this land of the mountains, and all the South, and all the land of Goshen, and the low country, and the plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the low country of the same, 

###### 17 
From the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto Baal Gad in the valley of Lebanon, under mount Hermon: and all their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them. 

###### 18 
Joshua made war [a] long time with all those Kings, 

###### 19 
Neither was there any city that made peace with the children of Israel, save those Hivites that inhabited Gibeon: all _others _they took by battle. 

###### 20 
For it came of the Lord, to harden their hearts that they should come against Israel in battle, to the intent that they should destroy them utterly, _and _show them no mercy, but that they should bring them to nought, as the Lord had commanded Moses. 

###### 21 
¶ And that same season came Joshua, and destroyed the Anakims out of the mountains: _as_ out of Hebron, out of Debir, out of Anab, and out of all the mountains of Judah, and out of all the mountains of Israel: Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities. 

###### 22 
There was no Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel, only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod were they left. 

###### 23 
So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the Lord had said unto Moses: and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto Israel, according to their portions through their tribes: then the land was at rest without war.
