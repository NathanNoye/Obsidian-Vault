###### 1 
And the lot fell to the children of Joseph from Jordan by Jericho unto the water of Jericho Eastward, _and_ to the wilderness that goeth up from Jericho by the mount Bethel: 

###### 2 
And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and runneth along unto the borders of Archi Ataroth, 

###### 3 
And goeth down Westward to the coast of Japhlet, unto the coast of Beth Horon the nether: and to Gezer, and the ends thereof are at the Sea. 

###### 4 
So the children of Joseph; Manasseh and Ephraim took their inheritance. 

###### 5 
¶ Also the borders of the children of Ephraim according to their families, even the borders of their inheritance on the East side were Ataroth Addar, unto Beth Horon the upper. 

###### 6 
And this border goeth out to the Sea unto Michmethath on the North side, and this border returneth Eastward unto Taanath Shiloh, and passeth it on the East side unto Janohah, 

###### 7 
And goeth down from Janohah unto Ataroth, and Naarah, and cometh to Jericho, and goeth out at Jordan. 

###### 8 
And this border goeth from Tappuah Westward unto the river Kanah, and the ends thereof are at the Sea: this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their families. 

###### 9 
And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim _were_ among the inheritance of the children of Manasseh: all the cities with their villages. 

###### 10 
And they cast not out the Canaanite that dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanite dwelt among the Ephraimites unto this day, and served under tribute.
