###### 1 
This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by their families: _even _to the border of Edom and the wilderness of Zin, Southward on the South coast. 

###### 2 
And their South border was the salt Sea coast, from the point that looketh Southward. 

###### 3 
And it went out on the South side toward Maaleh Akrabbim, and went along to Zin, and ascended up on the South side unto Kadesh Barnea, and went along to Hezron, and went up to Adar, and set a compass to Karkaa. 

###### 4 
From thence went it along to Azmon, and reached unto the river of Egypt, and the end of that coast was on the West side: this shall be your South coast. 

###### 5 
Also the East border shall be the salt Sea, unto the end of Jordan: and the border on the North quarter from the point of the Sea, _and_ from the end of Jordan. 

###### 6 
And this border goeth up to Beth Hoglah, and goeth along by the North side of Beth Arabah: so the border from thence goeth up to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 

###### 7 
Again this border goeth up to Debir from the valley of Achor, and Northward, turning toward Gilgal, that lieth before the going unto Adummim, which is on the South side of the river: also this border goeth up to the waters of En Shemesh, and endeth at En Rogel. 

###### 8 
Then this border goeth up to the valley of the son of Hinnom; on the South side of the Jebusites: the same is Jerusalem. Also this border goeth up to the top of the mountain that lieth before the valley of Hinnom Westward, which is by the end of the valley of giants Northward. 

###### 9 
So this border compasseth from the top of the mountain unto the fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and goeth out to the cities of mount Ephron: and this border draweth to Baalah which is Kirjath Jearim. 

###### 10 
Then this border compasseth from Baalah Westward unto mount Seir, and goeth along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is Chesalon on the North side: it cometh down to Beth Shemesh, and goeth to Timnah. 

###### 11 
Also this border goeth out unto the side of Ekron Northward: and this border draweth to Shicron, and goeth along to mount Baalah, and stretcheth unto Jabneel: and the ends of this coast are unto the Sea. 

###### 12 
And the West border _is_ to the great sea: so this border shall be the bounds of the children of Judah round about, according to their families. 

###### 13 
¶ And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh did Joshua give a part among the children of Judah, as the Lord commanded him, _even _Kirjath Arba of the father of Anak which is in Hebron. 

###### 14 
And Caleb drove thence three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai, the sons of Anak. 

###### 15 
And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the name of Debir beforetime _was_ Kirjath Sepher. 

###### 16 
Then Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjath Sepher, and taketh it, even to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife. 

###### 17 
And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb took it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife. 

###### 18 
And as she went in _to him_, she moved him, to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass, and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou? 

###### 19 
Then she answered, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given me the South country: give me also springs of water. And he gave her the springs above, and the springs beneath. 

###### 20 
This shall be the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah according to their families.
