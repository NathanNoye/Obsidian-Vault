###### 1 
Now when Joshua was old, _and _stricken in years, the Lord said unto him, Thou art old and grown in age, and there remaineth exceeding much land to be possessed: 

###### 2 
This is the land that remaineth, all the regions of the Philistines, and all Geshuri. 

###### 3 
From Nilus which is in Egypt, even unto the borders of Ekron Northward: this is counted of the Canaanites, even five Lordships of the Philistines, the Gazites, and the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites, and the Avites: 

###### 4 
From the South, all the land of the Canaanites, and the cave that is beside the Sidonians, unto Aphek, _and_ to the borders of the Amorites: 

###### 5 
And the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon toward the Sun rising from Baal Gad under mount Hermon, until one come to Hamath. 

###### 6 
All the inhabitants of the mountains from Lebanon unto Misrephoth, _and_ all the Sidonians, I will cast them out from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites, to inherit, as I have commanded thee. 

###### 7 
Now therefore divide this land to inherit, unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasseh. 

###### 8 
_For_ with _half _thereof the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance, which Moses gave them beyond Jordan Eastward, even as Moses the servant of the Lord had given them. 

###### 9 
From Aroer that is on the brink of the river Arnon, and from the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of Medeba unto Dibon, 

###### 10 
And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, unto the borders of the children of Ammon, 

###### 11 
And Gilead, and the borders of the Geshurites and of the Maachathites, and all mount Hermon, with all Bashan unto Salcah: 

###### 12 
All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei: (who remained of the rest of the giants) for these did Moses smite, and cast them out: 

###### 13 
But the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites even unto this day. 

###### 14 
Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance, _but_ the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel are his inheritance, as he said unto him. 

###### 15 
¶ Moses then gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben _inheritance_, according to their families. 

###### 16 
And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the brink of the river Arnon, and from the city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain which is by Medeba: 

###### 17 
Heshbon with all the cities thereof, that are in the plain: Dibon and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon: 

###### 18 
And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath: 

###### 19 
Kirjathaim also, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount of Emek: 

###### 20 
And Beth Peor, and Ashdoth Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth: 

###### 21 
And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the Princes of Midian, Evi and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country. 

###### 22 
And Balaam the son of Beor the soothsayer did the children of Israel slay with the sword, among them that were slain. 

###### 23 
And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan with the coasts. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben according to their families, with the cities and their villages. 

###### 24 
¶ Also Moses gave _inheritance_ unto the tribe of Gad, _even_ unto the children of Gad according to their families. 

###### 25 
And their coasts were Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the children of Ammon unto Aroer, which is before Rabbah: 

###### 26 
And from Heshbon unto Ramath, Mizpah, and Betonim: and from Mahanaim unto the borders of Debir: 

###### 27 
And in the valley of Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon unto Jordan and the borders even unto the sea coast of Chinnereth, beyond Jordan Eastward. 

###### 28 
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad, after their families, with the cities and their villages. 

###### 29 
¶ Also Moses gave _inheritance_ unto the half tribe of Manasseh: and this belonged to the half tribe of the children of Manasseh according to their families. 

###### 30 
And their border was from Mahanaim, _even _all Bashan, _to wit_, all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair which are in Bashan, threescore cities, 

###### 31 
And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, _were given_ unto the children of Machir the son of Manasseh to half of the children of Machir after their families. 

###### 32 
These are the heritages, which Moses did distribute in the plain of Moab beyond Jordan _toward _Jericho Eastward. 

###### 33 
But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave none inheritance: _for_ the Lord God of Israel is their inheritance, as he said unto them.
