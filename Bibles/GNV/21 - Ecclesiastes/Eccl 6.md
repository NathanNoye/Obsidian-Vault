###### 1 
There is an evil, which I saw under the sun, and it is much among men: 

###### 2 
A man to whom God hath given riches and treasures and honor, and he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth: but God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a strange man shall eat it up: this is vanity, and this is an evil sickness. 

###### 3 
If a man beget an hundred _children_ and live many years, and the days of his years be multiplied: and his soul be not satisfied with good things, and he be not buried, I say that an untimely fruit is better than he. 

###### 4 
For he cometh into vanity, and goeth into darkness: and his name shall be covered with darkness. 

###### 5 
Also he hath not seen the sun, nor known it: _therefore_ this hath more rest than the other. 

###### 6 
And if he had lived a thousand years twice told, and had seen no good, shall not all go to one place? 

###### 7 
All the labor of man _is_ for his mouth: yet the soul is not filled. 

###### 8 
For what hath the wise man more than the fool? what hath the poor that knoweth how to walk before the living? 

###### 9 
The sight of the eye is better than to walk in the lusts: this also is vanity, and vexation of spirit. 

###### 10 
What is that that hath been? the name thereof is now named: and it is known that it is man: and he cannot strive with him that is stronger than he.
