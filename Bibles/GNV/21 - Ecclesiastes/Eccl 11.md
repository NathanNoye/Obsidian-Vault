###### 1 
Cast thy bread upon the waters: for after many days thou shalt find it. 

###### 2 
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight: for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. 

###### 3 
If the clouds be full, they will pour forth rain upon the earth: and if the tree do fall toward the South, or toward the North, in the place that the tree falleth, there it shall be. 

###### 4 
He that observeth the wind shall not sow, and he that regardeth the clouds, shall not reap. 

###### 5 
As thou knowest not which is the way of the spirit, _nor_ how the bones _do grow_ in the womb of her that is with child: so thou knowest not the work of God that worketh all. 

###### 6 
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening let not thine hand rest: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, this or that, or whether both shall be a like good. 

###### 7 
Surely the light is a pleasant thing: and it is a good thing to the eyes to see the sun. 

###### 8 
Though a man live many years, _and_ in them all he rejoice, yet he shall remember the days of darkness, because they are many, all that cometh _is_ vanity. 

###### 9 
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thine heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth: and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know that for all these things, God will bring thee to judgment. 

###### 10 
Therefore take away grief out of thine heart, and cause evil to depart from thy flesh: for childhood and youth _are_ vanity.
