###### 1 
Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the evil days come not, nor the years approach, wherein thou shalt say, I have no pleasure in them: 

###### 2 
While the sun is not dark, nor the light, nor the moon, nor the stars, nor the clouds return after the rain. 

###### 3 
When the keepers of the house shall tremble, and the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders shall cease, because they are few, and they wax dark that look out by the windows: 

###### 4 
And the doors shall be shut without by the base sound of the grinding, and he shall rise up at the voice of the bird: and all the daughters of singing shall be abased: 

###### 5 
Also they shall be afraid of the high thing, and fear _shall be_ in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish, and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and concupiscence shall be driven away: for man goeth to the house of his age, and the mourners go about in the street. 

###### 6 
While the silver cord is not lengthened, nor the golden ewer broken, nor the pitcher broken at the well, nor the wheel broken at the cistern, 

###### 7 
And dust return to the earth as it was, and the spirit return to God that gave it. 

###### 8 
Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, all _is_ vanity. 

###### 9 
And the more wise the Preacher was, the more he taught the people knowledge, and caused them to hear, and searched forth, and prepared many parables. 

###### 10 
The Preacher sought to find out pleasant words, and an upright writing, _even_ the words of truth. 

###### 11 
The words of the wise are like goads, and like nails fastened by the masters of the assemblies, _which_ are given by one pastor. 

###### 12 
And of other things beside these, my son, take thou heed: for there is none end in making many books, and much reading is a weariness of the flesh. 

###### 13 
Let us hear the end of all: fear God and keep his commandments: for this is the whole _duty_ of man. 

###### 14 
For God will bring every work unto judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good or evil.
