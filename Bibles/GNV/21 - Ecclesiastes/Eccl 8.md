###### 1 
Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? the wisdom of a man doth make his face to shine: and the strength of his face shall be changed. 

###### 2 
_I advertise thee_ to take heed to the mouth of the king, and to the word of the oath of God. 

###### 3 
Haste not to go forth of his sight: stand not in an evil thing: for he will do whatsoever pleaseth him. 

###### 4 
Where the word of the King is, _there is_ power, and who shall say unto him, What doest thou? 

###### 5 
He that keepeth the commandment, shall know none evil thing, and the heart of the wise shall know the time, and judgment. 

###### 6 
For to every purpose there is a time and judgment, because the misery of man is great upon him. 

###### 7 
For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be? 

###### 8 
Man is not Lord over the spirit to retain the spirit: neither hath he power in the day of death, nor deliverance in the battle, neither shall wickedness deliver the possessors thereof. 

###### 9 
All this have I seen, and have given mine heart to every work which is wrought under the sun, _and I saw_ a time that man ruleth over man to his own hurt. 

###### 10 
And likewise I saw the wicked buried, and they returned, and they that came from the holy place, were yet forgotten in the city, where they had done right: this also is vanity. 

###### 11 
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the children of men is fully set in them to do evil. 

###### 12 
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and _God_ prolongeth _his days_, yet I know that it shall be well with them that fear the Lord, and do reverence before him. 

###### 13 
But it shall not be well to the wicked, neither shall he prolong _his_ days: _he shall be_ like a shadow, because he feareth not before God. 

###### 14 
There is a vanity, which is done upon the earth, that there be righteous men to whom it cometh according to the work of the wicked: and there be wicked men to whom it cometh according to the work of the just: I thought also that this is vanity. 

###### 15 
And I praised joy, for there is no goodness to man under the sun, save to eat and to drink and to rejoice: for this is adjoined to his labor the days of his life that God hath given him under the sun. 

###### 16 
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to behold the business that is done on earth, that neither day nor night the eyes of man take sleep, 

###### 17 
Then I beheld the whole work of God, that man cannot find out the work that is wrought under the sun: for the which man laboreth to seek it, and cannot find it: yea, and though the wise man think to know it, he cannot find it.
