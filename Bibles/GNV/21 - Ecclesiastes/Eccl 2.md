###### 1 
I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with joy: therefore take thou pleasure in pleasant things: and behold, this also is vanity. 

###### 2 
I said of laughter, Thou art mad: and of joy, What is this that thou doest? 

###### 3 
I sought in mine heart to give myself to wine, and to lead mine heart in wisdom, and to take hold of folly, till I might see where is that goodness of the children of men, which they enjoy under the Sun, the _whole_ number of the days of their life. 

###### 4 
I have made my great works: I have built me houses: I have planted me vineyards. 

###### 5 
I have made me gardens and orchards, and planted in them trees of all fruit. 

###### 6 
I have made me cisterns of water, to water therewith the woods that grow with trees. 

###### 7 
I have gotten servants and maids, and had children _born_ in the house: also I had great Possession of beeves and sheep above all that were before me in Jerusalem. 

###### 8 
I have gathered unto me also silver and gold, and the chief treasures of Kings and provinces: I have provided me men singers, and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, _as_ a woman taken captive, and women taken captives. 

###### 9 
And I was great, and increased above all that were before me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me. 

###### 10 
And whatsoever mine eyes desired, I withheld it not from them: I withdrew not mine heart from any joy: for mine heart rejoiced in all my labor: and this was my portion of all my travail. 

###### 11 
Then I looked on all my works that mine hands had wrought, and on the travail that I had labored to do: and behold, _all_ is vanity and vexation of the spirit: and there _is_ no profit under the Sun. 

###### 12 
¶ And I turned to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: (for who is the man that will come after the King in things, which men now have done?) 

###### 13 
Then I saw that there is profit in wisdom more than in folly: as the light is more excellent than darkness. 

###### 14 
For the wise man's eyes _are_ in his head, but the fool walketh in darkness: yet I know also that the same condition falleth to them all. 

###### 15 
Then I thought in mine heart, It befalleth unto me, as it befalleth to the fool. Why therefore do I then labor to be more wise? And I said in mine heart, that this also is vanity. 

###### 16 
For there shall be no remembrance of the wise, nor of the fool forever: for that that now is, in the days to come, shall all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man, as doth the fool? 

###### 17 
Therefore I hated life: for the work that is wrought under the Sun is grievous unto me: for all _is_ vanity, and vexation of the spirit. 

###### 18 
I hated also all my labor, wherein I had travailed under the Sun, which I shall leave to the man that shall be after me. 

###### 19 
And who knoweth whether he shall be wise or foolish? yet shall he have rule over all my labor, wherein I have travailed, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the Sun. This is also vanity. 

###### 20 
Therefore I went about to make mine heart abhor all the labor, wherein I had travailed under the Sun. 

###### 21 
For there is a man whose travail is in wisdom, and in knowledge, and in equity: yet to a man that hath not travailed herein, shall he give his portion: this also is vanity, and a great grief. 

###### 22 
For what hath man of all his travail and grief of his heart, wherein he hath travailed under the Sun? 

###### 23 
For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief: his heart also taketh not rest in the night: which also is vanity. 

###### 24 
There _is_ no profit to man, but that he eat and drink, and delight his soul with the profit of his labor: I saw also this, that it was of the hand of God. 

###### 25 
For who could eat, and who could haste to outward things more than I? 

###### 26 
Surely to a man that is good in his sight, _God_ giveth wisdom, and knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth pain to gather, and to heap to give to him that is good before God: this also is vanity, and vexation of the spirit.
