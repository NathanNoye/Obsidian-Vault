###### 1 
Surely there be many things that increase vanity, _and_ what availeth it a man? 

###### 2 
For who knoweth what is good for man in the life, _and_ in the number of the days of the life of his vanity, seeing he maketh them as a shadow? for who can show unto man what shall be after him under the sun? 

###### 3 
A good name _is better_ than a good ointment, and the day of death, than the day that one is born. 

###### 4 
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting, because this is the end of all men: and the living shall lay it to his heart. 

###### 5 
Anger is better than laughter: for by a sad look the heart is made better. 

###### 6 
The heart of the wise _is_ in the house of mourning: but the heart of fools _is_ in the house of mirth. 

###### 7 
Better it is to hear the rebuke of a wise man, than that a man should hear the song of fools. 

###### 8 
For like the noise of the thorns under the pot, so _is_ the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity. 

###### 9 
Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad: and the reward destroyeth the heart. 

###### 10 
The end of a thing is better than the beginning thereof, _and_ the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit. 

###### 11 
Be not thou of an hasty spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools. 

###### 12 
Say not thou, Why is it that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not inquire wisely of this thing. 

###### 13 
Wisdom is good with an inheritance, and excellent to them that see the sun. 

###### 14 
For _man shall rest_ in the shadow of wisdom, and in the shadow of silver: but the excellency of the knowledge of wisdom giveth life to the possessors thereof. 

###### 15 
Behold the work of God; for who can make straight that which he hath made crooked? 

###### 16 
In the day of wealth be of good comfort, and in the day of affliction consider: God also hath made this contrary to that, to the intent that man should find nothing after him. 

###### 17 
I have seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his justice, and there is a wicked man that continueth long in his malice. 

###### 18 
Be not thou just overmuch, neither make thyself overwise: wherefore shouldest thou be desolate? 

###### 19 
Be not thou wicked overmuch, neither be thou foolish: wherefore shouldest thou perish not in thy time? 

###### 20 
It is good that thou lay hold on this: but yet withdraw not thine hand from that: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all. 

###### 21 
Wisdom shall strengthen the wise men more than ten mighty princes that are in the city. 

###### 22 
Surely there is no man just in the earth that doeth good and sinneth not. 

###### 23 
Give not thine heart also to all the words that men speak, lest thou do hear thy servant cursing thee. 

###### 24 
For oftentimes also thine heart knoweth that thou likewise hast cursed others. 

###### 25 
All this have I proved by wisdom: I thought, I will be wise, but it went far from me. 

###### 26 
It is far off, what may it be? and it is a profound deepness, who can find it? 

###### 27 
I have compassed about, _both_ I and mine heart to know and to inquire and to search wisdom, and reason, and to know the wickedness of folly, and the foolishness of madness, 

###### 28 
And I find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is _as_ nets and snares, _and_ her hands _as_ bands: he that is good before God, shall be delivered from her, but the sinner shall be taken by her. 

###### 29 
Behold, saith the Preacher, this have I found, _seeking_ one by one to find the count: 

###### 30 
And yet my soul seeketh, but I find it not. I have found one man of a thousand: but a woman among them all have I not found. 

###### 31 
Only lo, this have I found, that God hath made man righteous: but they have sought many inventions.
