###### 1 
So I turned and considered all the oppressions that are wrought under the sun, and behold, the tears of the oppressed, and none comforteth them, and _lo_, the strength _is_ of the hand of them that oppress them, and none comforteth them. 

###### 2 
Wherefore I praised the dead which now are dead, above the living, which are yet alive. 

###### 3 
And _I count_ him better than them both, which hath not yet been: for he hath not seen the evil works which are wrought under the sun. 

###### 4 
Also I beheld all travail, and all perfection of works, that this is the envy of a man against his neighbor: this also _is_ vanity and vexation of spirit. 

###### 5 
The fool foldeth his hands, and eateth up his own flesh. 

###### 6 
Better is an handful with quietness, than two handfuls with labor and vexation of spirit. 

###### 7 
Again I returned, and saw vanity under the sun. 

###### 8 
There is one _alone_, and there _is_ not a second, which hath neither son nor brother, yet _is_ there none end of all his travail, neither can his eye be satisfied with riches: neither _doth he think_, For whom do I travail and defraud my soul of pleasures? this also is vanity, this is an evil travail. 

###### 9 
Two _are_ better wages for their labor. 

###### 10 
For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe unto him _that is_ alone: for he falleth, and there _is_ not a second to lift him up. 

###### 11 
Also if two sleep _together_, then shall they have heat: but to one how should there be heat? 

###### 12 
And if one overcome him, two shall stand against him: and a threefold cord is not easily broken. 

###### 13 
Better is a poor and wise child, than an old and foolish King, which will no more be admonished. 

###### 14 
For out of the prison he cometh forth to reign: when as he that is born in his kingdom, is made poor. 

###### 15 
I beheld all the living, which walk under the Sun with the second child, which shall stand up in his place. 

###### 16 
There is none end of all the people, _nor_ of all that were before them, and they that come after, shall not rejoice in him: surely this is also vanity and vexation of spirit. 

###### 17 
Take heed to thine foot when thou enterest into the house of God, and be more near to hear than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they know not that they do evil.
