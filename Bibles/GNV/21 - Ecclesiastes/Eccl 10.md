###### 1 
Dead flies cause to stink, and putrefy the ointment of the apothecary: _so doth_ a little folly him that is in estimation for wisdom, _and_ for glory. 

###### 2 
The heart of a wise man _is_ at his right hand: but the heart of a fool _is_ at his left hand. 

###### 3 
And also when the fool goeth by the way, his heart faileth, and he telleth unto all that he is a fool. 

###### 4 
If the spirit of him that ruleth, rise up against thee, leave not thy place: for gentleness pacifieth great sins. 

###### 5 
There is an evil _that_ I have seen under the sun, as an error that proceedeth from the face of him that ruleth. 

###### 6 
Folly is set in great excellency, and the rich sit in the low place. 

###### 7 
I have seen servants on horses, and princes walking as servants on the ground. 

###### 8 
He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it, and he that breaketh the hedge, a serpent shall bite him. 

###### 9 
He that removeth stones, shall hurt himself thereby, _and_ he that cutteth wood, shall be in danger thereby. 

###### 10 
If the iron be blunt, and one hath not whet the edge, he must then put to more strength: but the excellency to direct a thing _is_ wisdom. 

###### 11 
If the serpent bite, when he is not charmed: no better is a babbler. 

###### 12 
The words of the mouth of a wise man _have_ grace: but the lips of a fool devour himself. 

###### 13 
The beginning of the words of his mouth _is_ foolishness, and the latter end of his mouth _is_ wicked madness. 

###### 14 
For the fool multiplieth words, _saying_, Man knoweth not what shall be: and who can tell him what shall be after him? 

###### 15 
The labor of the foolish doth weary him: for he knoweth not to go into the city. 

###### 16 
Woe to thee, O land, when thy king _is_ a child, and thy princes eat in the morning. 

###### 17 
Blessed art thou, O land, when thy King _is_ the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in time, for strength and not for drunkenness. 

###### 18 
By slothfulness the roof of the house goeth to decay, and by the idleness of the hands the house droppeth through. 

###### 19 
They prepare bread for laughter, and wine comforteth the living, but silver answereth to all. 

###### 20 
Curse not the king, no not in thy thought, neither curse the rich in thy bed chamber: for the fowl of the heaven shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings, shall declare the matter.
