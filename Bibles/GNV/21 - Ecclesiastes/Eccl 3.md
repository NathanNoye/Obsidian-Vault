###### 1 
To all things _there is_ an appointed time, and a time to every purpose under the heaven. 

###### 2 
A time to be born, and a time to die: a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted. 

###### 3 
A time to slay, and a time to heal: a time to break down, and a time to build. 

###### 4 
A time to weep, and a time to laugh: a time to mourn, and a time to dance. 

###### 5 
A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones: a time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracing. 

###### 6 
A time to seek, and a time to lose: a time to keep, and a time to cast away. 

###### 7 
A time to rent, and a time to sow: a time to keep silence, and a time to speak. 

###### 8 
A time to love, and a time to hate: a time of war, and a time of peace. 

###### 9 
What profit _hath_ he that worketh of the thing wherein he travaileth? 

###### 10 
I have seen the travail that God hath given to the sons of men, to humble them thereby. 

###### 11 
He hath made everything beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, yet cannot man find out the work that God hath wrought from the beginning even to the end. 

###### 12 
I know that there is nothing good in them, but to rejoice, and to do good in his life. 

###### 13 
And also that every man eateth and drinketh, and seeth the commodity of all his labor. This is the gift of God. 

###### 14 
I know that whatsoever God shall do, it shall be forever: to it can no man add, and from it can none diminish: for God hath done it, that they should fear before him. 

###### 15 
What is that that hath been? that is now: and that that shall be, hath now been: for God requireth that which is past. 

###### 16 
And moreover, I have seen under the Sun the place of judgment, where _was_ wickedness, and the place of justice, where _was_ iniquity. 

###### 17 
I thought in mine heart, God will judge the just and the wicked: for time is there for every purpose and for every work. 

###### 18 
I considered in mine heart the state of the children of men, that God had purged them: yet to see too, they are in themselves _as_ beasts. 

###### 19 
For the condition of the children of men, and the condition of beasts _are_ even _as_ one condition unto them. As the one dieth, so dieth the other: for they have all one breath, and there is no excellency of man above the beast: for all _is_ vanity. 

###### 20 
All go to one place, and all was of the dust, and all shall return to the dust. 

###### 21 
Who knoweth whether the spirit of man ascend upward, and the spirit of the beast descend downward to the earth? 

###### 22 
Therefore I see that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his affairs, because that is his portion. For who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?
