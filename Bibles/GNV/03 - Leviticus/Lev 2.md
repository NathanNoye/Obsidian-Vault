###### 1 
And when any will offer a meat offering unto the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil upon it, and put incense thereon. 

###### 2 
And shall bring it unto Aaron's sons the Priests, and he shall take thence his handful of the flour, and of the oil with all the incense, and the Priest shall burn it for a memorial upon the altar: _for_ it is an offering made by fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 3 
But the remnant of the meat offering _shall be_ Aaron's and his sons': _for_ it is most holy of the Lord's offerings made by fire. 

###### 4 
¶ If thou bring also a meat offering baked in the oven, _it shall be_ an unleavened cake of fine flour mingled with oil, or an unleavened wafer anointed with oil. 

###### 5 
¶ But if thy meat offering _be_ an oblation of the frying pan, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil. 

###### 6 
And thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: _for_ it is a meat offering. 

###### 7 
¶ And if thy meat offering _be_ an oblation _made_ in the caldron, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 

###### 8 
After, thou shalt bring the meat offering (that is made of these things) unto the Lord, and shalt present it unto the Priest, and he shall bring it to the altar, 

###### 9 
And the Priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial of it, and shall burn it upon the altar: _for_ it is an oblation made by fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 10 
But that which is left of the meat offering, _shall be_ Aaron's and his sons': _for it is_ most holy of the offerings of the Lord made by fire. 

###### 11 
All the meat offerings which ye shall offer unto the Lord, shall be made without leaven: for ye shall neither burn leaven nor honey in any offering of the Lord made by fire. 

###### 12 
¶ _In_ the oblation of the firstfruits ye shall offer them unto the Lord, but they shall not be burnt upon the altar for a sweet savor, 

###### 13 
(All the meat offerings also shalt thou season with salt, neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering, _but_ upon all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt.) 

###### 14 
If then thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord, thou shalt offer for thy meat offering of thy firstfruits ears of corn dried by the fire, and wheat beaten out of the green ears. 

###### 15 
After, thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay incense thereon: _for_ it is a meat offering. 

###### 16 
And the Priest shall burn the memorial of it, _even_ of that, that is beaten, and of the oil of it with all the incense thereof: _for_ it is an offering unto the Lord made by fire.
