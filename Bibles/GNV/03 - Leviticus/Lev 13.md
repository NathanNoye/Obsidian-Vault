###### 1 
Moreover the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying, 

###### 2 
The man that shall have in the skin of his flesh a swelling or a scab, or a white spot, so that in the skin of his flesh it be like the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought unto Aaron the Priest, or unto one of his sons the Priests, 

###### 3 
And the Priest shall look on the sore in the skin of _his_ flesh: if the hair in the sore be turned into white, and the sore seen to be lower than the skin of his flesh, it is a plague of leprosy: therefore the Priest shall look on him, and pronounce him unclean. 

###### 4 
But if the white spot be in the skin of his flesh, and seem not to be lower than the skin, nor the hair thereof be turned unto white, then the Priest shall shut up _him that hath_ the plague, seven days. 

###### 5 
After, the Priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if the plague seem to him to abide still, and the plague grow not in the skin, the Priest shall shut him up yet seven days more. 

###### 6 
Then the Priest shall look on him again the seventh day, and if the plague be dark, and the sore grow not in the skin, then the Priest shall pronounce him clean, _for_ it is a scab: therefore he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 

###### 7 
But if the scab grow more in the skin, after that he is seen of the Priest for to be purged, he shall be seen of the Priest yet again. 

###### 8 
Then the Priest shall consider, and if the scab grow in the skin, then the Priest shall pronounce him unclean: _for_ it is leprosy. 

###### 9 
¶ When the plague of leprosy is in a man, he shall be brought unto the Priest, 

###### 10 
And the Priest shall see _him_: and if the swelling _be_ white in the skin, and have made the hair white, and there be raw flesh in the swelling, 

###### 11 
It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh: and the Priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up, for he is unclean. 

###### 12 
Also if the leprosy break out in the skin, and the leprosy cover all the skin of the plague, from his head even to his feet, wheresoever the Priest looketh, 

###### 13 
Then the Priest shall consider: and if the leprosy cover all his flesh, he shall pronounce the plague to be clean, because it is all turned into whiteness: _so_ he shall be clean. 

###### 14 
But if _there be_ raw flesh on him when he is seen, he shall be unclean. 

###### 15 
For the Priest shall see the raw flesh, and declare him to be unclean: _for_ the raw flesh is unclean, _therefore_ it is the leprosy. 

###### 16 
Or if the raw flesh change and be turned into white, then he shall come to the Priest, 

###### 17 
And the Priest shall behold him: and if the sore be changed into white, then the Priest shall pronounce the plague clean, _for_ it is clean. 

###### 18 
¶ The flesh also in whose skin there is a boil, and is healed 

###### 19 
And in the place of the boil there be a white swelling, or a white spot somewhat reddish, it shall be seen of the Priest. 

###### 20 
And when the Priest seeth it, if it appear lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be changed into white, the Priest then shall pronounce him unclean: _for_ it is a plague of leprosy, broken out in the boil. 

###### 21 
But if the Priest look on it, and there be no white hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be darker, then the Priest shall shut him up seven days. 

###### 22 
And if it spread abroad in the flesh, the Priest shall pronounce him unclean, _for_ it is a sore. 

###### 23 
But if the spot continue in his place, and grow not, it is a burning boil: therefore the Priest shall declare him to be clean. 

###### 24 
¶ If there be any flesh, in whose skin there is an hot burning, and the quick flesh of the burning have a white spot, somewhat reddish or pale, 

###### 25 
Then the Priest shall look upon it: and if the hair in that spot be changed into white, and it appear lower than the skin, it is a leprosy broken out in the burning: therefore the Priest shall pronounce him unclean: _for_ it is the plague of leprosy. 

###### 26 
But if the Priest look on it, and there be no white hair in the spot, and be no lower than the _other_ skin, but be darker, then the Priest shall shut him up seven days. 

###### 27 
After, the Priest shall look on him the seventh day: if it be grown abroad in the skin, then the Priest shall pronounce him unclean: _for_ it is the plague of leprosy. 

###### 28 
And if the spot abide in his place, not growing in the skin, but is dark, it is a rising of the burning: the Priest shall therefore declare him clean: for it is the drying up of the burning. 

###### 29 
¶ If also a man or a woman hath a sore on the head or in the beard, 

###### 30 
Then the Priest shall see the sore: and if it appears lower than the skin, and there be in it a small yellow hair, then the Priest shall pronounce him unclean: _for_ it is a black spot, and leprosy of the head or of the beard. 

###### 31 
And if the Priest look on the sore of the black spot, and if it seem not lower than the skin, nor have any black hair in it, then the Priest shall shut up _him that hath_ the sore of the black spot, seven days. 

###### 32 
After, in the seventh day the Priest shall look on the sore: and if the black spot grow not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the black spot seem not lower than the skin, 

###### 33 
Then he shall be shaven, but _the place_ of the black spot shall he not shave: but the Priest shall shut up _him that hath_ black spot, seven days more. 

###### 34 
And the seventh day the Priest shall look on the black spot: and if the black spot grow not in the skin, nor seem lower than the _other_ skin, then the Priest shall cleanse him, and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean. 

###### 35 
But if the black spot grow abroad in the flesh after his cleansing, 

###### 36 
Then the Priest shall look on it, and if the black spot grow in the skin, the Priest shall not seek for the yellow hair: _for_ it is unclean. 

###### 37 
But if the black spot seem to him to abide, and that black hair grow therein, the black spot is healed, he _is_ clean, and the Priest shall declare him to be clean. 

###### 38 
¶ Furthermore if there be any white spots in the skin of the flesh of man or woman, 

###### 39 
Then the Priest shall consider: and if the spots in the skin of their flesh be somewhat dark and white withal, it is but a white spot broken out in the skin: _therefore_ he is clean. 

###### 40 
And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, _and_ is bald, is clean. 

###### 41 
And if his head lose the hair on the forepart, _and_ be bald before, he is clean. 

###### 42 
But if there be in the bald head, or in the bald forehead a white reddish sore, it is a leprosy springing in his bald head, or in his bald forehead. 

###### 43 
Therefore the Priest shall look upon it, and if the rising of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, appearing like leprosy in the skin of the flesh, 

###### 44 
He is a leper and unclean: _therefore_ the Priest shall pronounce him altogether unclean: _for_ the sore _is_ in his head. 

###### 45 
The leper also in whom the plague is, shall have his clothes rent, and his head bare, and shall put a covering upon his lips, and shall cry, _I am_ unclean, _I am_ unclean. 

###### 46 
As long as the disease _shall be_ upon him, he shall be polluted, _for_ he is unclean: he shall dwell alone, without the camp _shall_ his habitation _be_. 

###### 47 
¶ Also the garment that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it be a woolen garment or a linen garment, 

###### 48 
Whether it be in the warp or in the woof of linen or of woolen, either in a skin, or in anything made of skin, 

###### 49 
And if the sore be green or somewhat reddish in the garment or in the skin, or in the warp or in the woof, or in anything that is made of skin, it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the Priest. 

###### 50 
Then the Priest shall see the plague, and shut up _it that hath_ the plague, seven days, 

###### 51 
And shall look on the plague the seventh day: if the plague grow in the garment or in the warp, or in the woof, or in the skin, or in anything that is made of skin, that plague _is_ a fretting leprosy and unclean. 

###### 52 
And he shall burn the garment, or the warp, or the woof, whether it be woolen or linen, or anything that is made of skin, wherein the plague is: for it is a fretting leprosy, _therefore_ it shall be burnt in the fire. 

###### 53 
If the Priest yet see that the plague grow not in the garment, or in the woof, or in whatsoever thing of skin it be, 

###### 54 
Then the Priest shall command them to wash the thing wherein the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more. 

###### 55 
Again the Priest shall look on the plague, after it is washed: and if the plague have not changed his color, though the plague spread no further, it is unclean: thou shalt burn it in the fire, _for_ it is a fret inward, whether _the spot_ be in the bare place of the whole, or in part thereof. 

###### 56 
And if the Priest see that the plague be darker, after that it is washed, he shall cut it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof. 

###### 57 
And if it appear still in the garment or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of skin, it is a spreading _leprosy_: thou shalt burn the thing wherein the plague is, in the fire. 

###### 58 
If thou hast washed the garment, or the warp, or the woof, or whatsoever thing of skin it be, if the plague be departed therefrom, then shall it be washed the second time, and be clean. 

###### 59 
This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woolen or linen, or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything of skin, to make it clean or unclean.
