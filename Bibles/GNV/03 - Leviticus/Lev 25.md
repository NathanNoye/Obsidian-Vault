###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye shall come into the land which I give you, the land shall keep Sabbath unto the Lord. 

###### 3 
Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt cut thy vineyard, and gather the fruit thereof. 

###### 4 
But the seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the land: _it shall be_ the Lord's Sabbath: thou shalt neither sow thy field nor cut thy vineyard. 

###### 5 
That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest, thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes that thou hast left unlabored: _for_ it shall be a year of rest unto the land. 

###### 6 
And the rest of the land shall be meat for you, _even_ for thee and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for the stranger that sojourneth with thee: 

###### 7 
And for thy cattle, and for the beasts that are in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be meat. 

###### 8 
¶ Also thou shalt number seven Sabbaths of years unto thee, _even_ seven times seven years: and the space of the seven Sabbaths of years will be unto thee nine and forty years. 

###### 9 
Then thou shalt cause to blow the trumpet of the Jubilee in the tenth _day_ of the seventh month: even in the day of the reconciliation shall ye make the trumpet blow throughout all your land. 

###### 10 
And ye shall hallow that year, _even_ the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty in the land to all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be the Jubilee unto you, and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and every man shall return unto his family. 

###### 11 
This fiftieth year shall be a year of Jubilee unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself, neither gather _the grapes_ thereof that are left unlabored. 

###### 12 
For it is the Jubilee, it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat of the increase thereof out of the field. 

###### 13 
In the year of this Jubilee, ye shall return every man unto his possession. 

###### 14 
And when thou sellest ought to thy neighbor, or buyest at thy neighbor's hand, ye shall not oppress one another. 

###### 15 
_But_ according to the number of years after the Jubilee, thou shalt buy of thy neighbor: _also_ according to the number of the years of the revenues, he shall sell unto thee. 

###### 16 
According to the multitude of years, thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt abate the price of it: for the number of fruits doth he sell unto thee. 

###### 17 
Oppress not ye therefore any man his neighbor, but thou shalt fear thy God: for I am the Lord your God. 

###### 18 
¶ Wherefore ye shall obey mine ordinances, and keep my laws, and do them, and ye shall dwell in the land in safety. 

###### 19 
And the land shall give her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety. 

###### 20 
And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year, for we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase? 

###### 21 
I will send my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years. 

###### 22 
And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the old fruit until the ninth year: until the fruit thereof come ye shall eat the old. 

###### 23 
¶ Also the land shall not be sold to be cut off _from the family_: for the land is mine, _and_ ye be but strangers and sojourners with me. 

###### 24 
Therefore in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption of the land. 

###### 25 
¶ If thy brother be impoverished, and sell his possession, then his redeemer shall come, _even_ his near kinsman, and buy out that, which his brother sold. 

###### 26 
And if he have no redeemer, but hath gotten and found to buy it out, 

###### 27 
Then shall he count the years of his sale, and restore the overplus to the man, to whom he sold it: so shall he return to his possession. 

###### 28 
But if he cannot get sufficient to restore to him, then that which is sold, shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it, until the year of the Jubilee: and in the Jubilee it shall come out, and he shall return unto his possession. 

###### 29 
Likewise if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, he may buy it out again within a whole year after it is sold: within a year may he buy it out. 

###### 30 
But if it be not bought out within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city, shall be stablished, as cut off _from the family_, to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the Jubilee. 

###### 31 
But the houses of villages which have no walls round about them, shall be esteemed as the field of the country: they may be bought out again, and shall go out in the Jubilee. 

###### 32 
Notwithstanding, the cities of the Levites, _and_ the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at all seasons. 

###### 33 
And if a man purchase of the Levites, the house that was sold, and the city of their possession shall go out in the Jubilee: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession among the children of Israel. 

###### 34 
But the field of the suburbs of their cities shall not be sold: for it is their perpetual possession. 

###### 35 
¶ Moreover, if thy brother be impoverished, and fallen in decay with thee, thou shalt relieve him, and _as_ a stranger and sojourner, so shall he live with thee. 

###### 36 
Thou shalt take no usury of him, nor vantage, but thou shalt fear thy God, that thy brother may live with thee. 

###### 37 
Thou shalt not give him thy money to usury, nor lend him thy vittles for increase. 

###### 38 
I am the Lord your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, _and_ to be your God. 

###### 39 
¶ If thy brother also _that dwelleth_ by thee be impoverished, and be sold unto thee, thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bond servant, 

###### 40 
_But_ as an hired servant, and as a sojourner he shall be with thee: he shall serve thee unto the year of Jubilee. 

###### 41 
Then shall he depart from thee, _both_ he and his children with him, and shall return unto his family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return: 

###### 42 
For they are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen are sold. 

###### 43 
Thou shalt not rule over him cruelly, but shalt fear thy God. 

###### 44 
Thy bond servant also, and thy bondmaid, which thou shalt have, _shall be_ of the heathen that are round about you: of them shall ye buy servants and maids. 

###### 45 
And moreover, of the children of the strangers that are sojourners among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that are with you which they begat in your land: these shall be your possession. 

###### 46 
So ye shall take them, as inheritance for your children after you to possess them by inheritance, ye shall use their labors forever: but over your brethren the children of Israel ye shall not rule one over another with cruelty. 

###### 47 
¶ If a sojourner or a stranger _dwelling_ by thee get _riches_, and thy brother by him be impoverished, and sell himself unto the stranger or sojourner _dwelling_ by thee, or to the stock of the stranger's family, 

###### 48 
After that he is sold, he may be bought out: one of his brethren may buy him out. 

###### 49 
Or his uncle, or his uncle's son may buy him out, or _any_ of the kindred of his flesh among his family, may redeem him: either if he can get _so much_, he may buy himself out. 

###### 50 
Then he shall reckon with his buyer from the year that he was sold to him, unto the year of Jubilee: and the money of his sale shall be according to the number of years: according to the time of an hired servant shall he be with him. 

###### 51 
If there be many years behind, according to them shall he give again for his deliverance, of the money that he was bought for. 

###### 52 
If there remain but few years unto the year of Jubilee, then he shall count with him, and according to his years give again for his redemption. 

###### 53 
He shall be with him year by year as an hired servant: he shall not rule cruelly over him in thy sight. 

###### 54 
And if he be not redeemed thus, he shall go out in the year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him. 

###### 55 
For unto me the children of Israel _are_ servants, they are my servants whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
