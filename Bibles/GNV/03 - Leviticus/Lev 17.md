###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel, and say unto them, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, saying, 

###### 3 
Whosoever _he be_ of the house of Israel that killeth a bullock, or lamb, or goat in the host, or that killeth it out of the host, 

###### 4 
And bringeth it not unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer an offering unto the Lord before the Tabernacle of the Lord, blood shall be imputed unto that man: he hath shed blood, wherefore that man shall be cut off from among his people. 

###### 5 
Therefore the children of Israel shall bring their offerings, which they would offer abroad in the field, and present them unto the Lord at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation by the Priest, and offer them for peace offerings unto the Lord. 

###### 6 
Then the Priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the Altar of the Lord before the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and burn the fat for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 7 
And they shall no more offer their offerings unto devils, after whom they have gone a whoring: this shall be an ordinance forever unto them in their generations. 

###### 8 
¶ Also thou shalt say unto them, Whosoever _he be_ of the house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among them, that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice, 

###### 9 
And bringeth it not unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation to offer it unto the Lord, even that man shall be cut off from his people. 

###### 10 
¶ Likewise whosoever _he be_ of the house of Israel: or of the strangers that sojourn among them, that eateth any blood, I will even set my face against that person that eateth blood, and will cut him off from among his people. 

###### 11 
For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it unto you _to offer_ upon the altar, to make an atonement for your souls: for this blood shall make an atonement for the soul. 

###### 12 
Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, None of you shall eat blood: neither the stranger that sojourneth among you, shall eat blood. 

###### 13 
Moreover whosoever _he be_ of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among them, which by hunting taketh any beast or fowl that may be eaten, he shall pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust: 

###### 14 
For the life of all flesh is his blood, it is _joined_ with his life: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no flesh: for the life of all flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it, shall be cut off. 

###### 15 
And every person that eateth it which dieth _alone_, or that which is torn _with beasts_, whether it be one of the same country or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and wash himself in water, and be unclean unto the even: after he shall be clean. 

###### 16 
But if he wash _them_ not, nor wash his flesh, then he shall bear his iniquity.
