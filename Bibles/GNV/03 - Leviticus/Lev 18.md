###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the Lord your God. 

###### 3 
After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall ye not do: and after the manner of the land of Canaan, whither I will bring you, shall ye not do, neither walk in their ordinances. 

###### 4 
_But_ do after my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk therein: I am the Lord your God. 

###### 5 
Ye shall keep therefore my statutes, and my judgments, which if a man do, he shall then live in them: I am the Lord. 

###### 6 
¶ None shall come near to any of the kindred of his flesh to uncover _her_ shame: I am the Lord. 

###### 7 
Thou shalt not uncover the shame of thy father, nor the shame of thy mother, _for_ she is thy mother, thou shalt not discover her shame. 

###### 8 
The shame of thy father's wife shalt thou not discover: _for_ it is thy father's shame. 

###### 9 
Thou shalt not discover the shame of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or the daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home or born without: thou shalt not discover their shame. 

###### 10 
The shame of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's daughter, thou shalt not, I say, uncover their shame: for it is thy shame. 

###### 11 
The shame of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy father (_for_ she is thy sister) thou shalt not, I _say_, discover her shame. 

###### 12 
Thou shalt not uncover the shame of thy father's sister: _for_ she is thy father's kinswoman. 

###### 13 
Thou shalt not discover the shame of thy mother's sister: for she is thy mother's kinswoman. 

###### 14 
Thou shalt not uncover the shame of thy father's brother: _that is_, thou shalt not go in to his wife, _for_ she is thine aunt. 

###### 15 
Thou shalt not discover the shame of thy daughter-in-law: _for_ she is thy son's wife: _therefore_ shalt thou not uncover her shame. 

###### 16 
Thou shalt not discover the shame of thy brother's wife: _for_ it is thy brother's shame. 

###### 17 
Thou shalt not discover the shame of the wife and of her daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, nor her daughter's daughter, to uncover her shame: _for_ they are _thy_ kinsfolks, _and_ it were wickedness. 

###### 18 
Also thou shalt not take a wife with her sister, during her life to vex _her_, in uncovering her shame upon her. 

###### 19 
Thou shalt not also go unto a woman to uncover her shame, as long as she is put apart for her disease. 

###### 20 
Moreover, thou shalt not give _thy _self to thy neighbor's wife by carnal copulation, to be defiled with her. 

###### 21 
Also thou shalt not give thy children to offer _them_ unto Molech, neither shalt thou defile the Name of thy God: _for_ I am the Lord. 

###### 22 
Thou shalt not lie with the male as one lieth with a woman: _for_ it is abomination. 

###### 23 
Thou shalt not also lie with any beast to be defiled therewith, neither shall any woman stand before a beast, to lie down thereto: _for_ it is abomination. 

###### 24 
Ye shall not defile yourselves in any of these things: for in all these the Nations are defiled which I will cast out before you: 

###### 25 
And the land is defiled: therefore I will visit the wickedness thereof upon it, and the land shall vomit out her inhabitants. 

###### 26 
Ye shall keep therefore mine ordinances, and my judgments, and commit none of these abominations, _as well_ he that is of the same country, as the stranger that sojourneth among you. 

###### 27 
(For all these abominations have the men of the land done, which were before you, and the land is defiled: 

###### 28 
And shall not the land spew you out if ye defile it, as it spewed out the people that were before you?) 

###### 29 
For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, the persons that do _so_, shall be cut off from among their people. 

###### 30 
Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinances, that ye do not any of the abominable customs, which have been done before you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: _for_ I am the Lord your God.
