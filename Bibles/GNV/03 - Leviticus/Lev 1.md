###### 1 
Now the Lord called Moses, and spake unto him out of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and thou shalt say unto them, If any of you offer a sacrifice unto the Lord, ye shall offer your sacrifice of cattle, _as_ of beeves and of the sheep. 

###### 3 
If his sacrifice _be_ a burnt offering of the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish, presenting him of his own voluntary will at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord. 

###### 4 
And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted to _the Lord_, to be his atonement. 

###### 5 
And he shall kill the bullock before the Lord, and the Priests Aaron's sons shall offer the blood, and shall sprinkle it round about upon the altar, that is by the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 6 
Then shall he slay the burnt offering, and cut it in pieces. 

###### 7 
So the sons of Aaron the Priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire. 

###### 8 
Then the Priests Aaron's sons shall lay the parts in order, the head and the caul upon the wood that is in the fire which is upon the altar. 

###### 9 
But the inwards thereof and the legs thereof he shall wash in water, and the Priest shall burn all on the altar: _for_ it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire, for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 10 
¶ And if his sacrifice for the burnt offering _be_ of the flocks (_as_ of the sheep, or of the goats) he shall offer a male without blemish. 

###### 11 
And he shall kill it on the North side of the altar before the Lord, and the Priests Aaron's sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar. 

###### 12 
And he shall cut it in pieces, _separating_ his head and his caul, and the Priest shall lay them in order upon the wood that _lieth_ in the fire which is on the altar: 

###### 13 
But he shall wash the inwards, and the legs with water, and the Priest shall offer the whole and burn it upon the altar: _for_ it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 14 
¶ And if his sacrifice _be_ a burnt offering to the Lord of the fowls, then shall he offer his sacrifice of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons. 

###### 15 
And the Priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring the neck of it asunder, and burn it on the altar: and the blood thereof shall be shed upon the side of the altar. 

###### 16 
And he shall pluck out his maw with his feathers, and cast them beside the altar on the East part in the place of the ashes. 

###### 17 
And he shall cleave it with his wings, _but_ not divide it asunder: and the Priest shall burn it upon the altar upon the wood that is in the fire: _for_ it is a burnt offering, an oblation made by fire for a sweet savor unto the Lord.
