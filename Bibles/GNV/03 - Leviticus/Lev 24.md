###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten, for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually. 

###### 3 
Without the veil of the Testimony, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, shall Aaron dress them, both even and morning before the Lord always: _this shall be_ a law forever through your generations. 

###### 4 
He shall dress the lamps upon the pure Candlestick before the Lord perpetually. 

###### 5 
¶ Also thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake. 

###### 6 
And thou shalt set them in two rows, six in a row upon the pure table before the Lord. 

###### 7 
Thou shalt also put pure incense upon the rows, that instead of the bread it may be for a remembrance, _and_ an offering made by fire unto the Lord. 

###### 8 
Every Sabbath he shall put them in rows before the Lord evermore, _receiving them_ of the children of Israel for an everlasting Covenant. 

###### 9 
And the _bread_ shall be Aaron's and his sons', and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the offerings of the Lord made by fire by a perpetual ordinance. 

###### 10 
¶ And there went out among the children of Israel the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian: and this son of the Israelitish woman, and a man of Israel strove together in the host. 

###### 11 
So the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the Name _of the Lord_, and cursed, and they brought him unto Moses (his mother's name also was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan) 

###### 12 
And they put him in ward, till he told them the mind of the Lord. 

###### 13 
Then the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 14 
Bring the blasphemer without the host, and let all that heard him, put their hands upon his head, and let all the Congregation stone him. 

###### 15 
And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God, shall bear his sin. 

###### 16 
And he that blasphemeth the Name of the Lord, shall be put to death: all the Congregation shall stone him to death: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land: when he blasphemeth the Name _of the Lord_, let him be slain. 

###### 17 
¶ He also that killeth any man, he shall be put to death. 

###### 18 
And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it, beast for beast. 

###### 19 
Also if a man cause _any_ blemish in his neighbor: as he hath done, so shall it be done to him: 

###### 20 
Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: such a blemish as he hath made in any, such shall be repaid to him. 

###### 21 
And he that killeth a beast, shall restore it: but he that killeth a man, shall be slain. 

###### 22 
Ye shall have one law: it shall be as well for the stranger as for one born in the country, for I am the Lord your God. 

###### 23 
¶ Then Moses told the children of Israel, and they brought the blasphemer out of the host, and stoned him with stones: so the children of Israel did as the Lord had commanded Moses.
