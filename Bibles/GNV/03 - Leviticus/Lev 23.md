###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, The feasts of the Lord which ye shall call the holy assemblies, _even_ these are my feasts. 

###### 3 
Six days shall work be done, but in the seventh day _shall be_ the Sabbath of rest, an holy convocation: ye shall do no work _therein_, it is the Sabbath of the Lord, in all your dwellings. 

###### 4 
¶ These are the feasts of the Lord, _and_ holy convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons. 

###### 5 
In the first month _and_ in the fourteenth _day_ of the month at evening _shall be_ the Passover of the Lord. 

###### 6 
And on the fifteenth day of this month _shall be_ the feast of unleavened bread unto the Lord: seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread. 

###### 7 
In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work _therein_. 

###### 8 
Also ye shall offer sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord seven days, _and_ in the seventh day _shall be_ an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work _therein_. 

###### 9 
¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 10 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the Priest, 

###### 11 
And he shall shake the sheaf before the Lord, that it may be acceptable for you: the morrow after the Sabbath, the Priest shall shake it. 

###### 12 
And that day when ye shake the sheaf, shall ye prepare a lamb without blemish of a year old, for a burnt offering unto the Lord: 

###### 13 
And the meat offering thereof _shall be_ two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil, for a sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord of sweet savor: and the drink offering thereof the fourth part of an Hin of wine. 

###### 14 
And ye shall eat neither bread nor parched corn, nor green ears until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering unto your God: _this shall be_ a Law forever in your generations and in all your dwellings. 

###### 15 
¶ Ye shall count also to you from the morrow after the Sabbath, _even_ from the day that ye shall bring the sheaf of the shake offering, seven Sabbaths, they shall be complete. 

###### 16 
Unto the morrow after the seventh Sabbath shall ye number fifty days: then ye shall bring a new meat offering unto the Lord. 

###### 17 
Ye shall bring out of your habitations bread for the shake offering: they shall be two _loaves_ of two tenth deals of fine flour, _which_ shall be baken with leaven for firstfruits unto the Lord. 

###### 18 
Also ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of one year old, and a young bullock and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the Lord, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings, for a sacrifice made by fire of a sweet savor unto the Lord. 

###### 19 
Then ye shall prepare an he goat for a sin offering, and two lambs of one year old for peace offerings. 

###### 20 
And the Priest shall shake them to and fro with the bread of the firstfruits before the Lord, _and_ with the two lambs: they shall be holy to the Lord, for the Priest. 

###### 21 
So ye shall proclaim the same day, _that_ it may be an holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work _therein_: _it shall be_ an ordinance forever in all your dwellings, throughout your generations. 

###### 22 
¶ And when you reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not rid clean the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou make any aftergathering of thy harvest, _but_ shalt leave them unto the poor and to the stranger, I am the Lord your God. 

###### 23 
¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 24 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say, In the seventh month, _and_ in the first _day_ of the month shall ye have a Sabbath, for the remembrance of blowing the trumpets, an holy convocation. 

###### 25 
Ye shall do no servile work _therein_, but offer sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. 

###### 26 
¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 27 
The tenth also of this seventh month, shall be a day of reconciliation: it shall be an holy convocation unto you, and ye shall humble your souls, and offer sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord. 

###### 28 
And ye shall do no work that same day: for it is a day of reconciliation, to make an atonement for you before the Lord your God. 

###### 29 
For every person that humbleth not himself that same day, shall even be cut off from his people. 

###### 30 
And every person that shall do any work that same day, the same person also will I destroy from among his people. 

###### 31 
Ye shall do no manner work _therefore_: _this shall be_ a law forever in your generations, _throughout_ all your dwellings. 

###### 32 
This shall be unto you a Sabbath of rest, and ye shall humble your souls: in the ninth _day_ of the month at even, from even to even shall ye celebrate your Sabbath. 

###### 33 
¶ And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 34 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say, In the fifteenth day of this seventh month _shall be_ for seven days the feast of Tabernacles unto the Lord. 

###### 35 
In the first day _shall be_ an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work _therein_. 

###### 36 
Seven days ye shall offer sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, _and_ in the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you, and ye shall offer sacrifices made by fire unto the Lord: it is the solemn assembly, ye shall do no servile work _therein_. 

###### 37 
These are the feasts of the Lord (which ye shall call holy convocations) to offer sacrifice made by fire unto the Lord, _as_ burnt offering, and meat offering, sacrifice, and drink offerings, every one upon his day, 

###### 38 
Beside the Sabbaths of the Lord, and beside your gifts, and beside all your vows, and beside all your free offerings, which ye shall give unto the Lord. 

###### 39 
But in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep an holy feast unto the Lord seven days: in the first day _shall be_ a Sabbath: likewise in the eighth day _shall be_ a Sabbath. 

###### 40 
And ye shall take you in the first day the fruit of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook, and shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days. 

###### 41 
So ye shall keep this feast unto the Lord seven days in the year, by a perpetual ordinance through your generations: in the seventh month shall you keep it. 

###### 42 
Ye shall dwell in booths seven days: all that are Israelites born, shall dwell in booths, 

###### 43 
That your posterity may know that I have made the children of Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. 

###### 44 
So Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of the Lord.
