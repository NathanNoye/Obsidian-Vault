###### 1 
Moreover, the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any shall sin through ignorance, in any of the commandments of the Lord, (which ought not to be done) but shall do _contrary_ to any of them, 

###### 3 
If the Priest that is anointed do sin (according to the sin of the people) then shall he offer, for his sin which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering, 

###### 4 
And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation before the Lord, and shall put his hand upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the Lord. 

###### 5 
And the Priest that is anointed, shall take of the bullock's blood, and bring it into the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 6 
Then the Priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord, before the veil of the Sanctuary. 

###### 7 
The Priest also shall put _some_ of the blood before the Lord, upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense, which is in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, then shall he pour all _the rest_ of the blood of the bullock at the foot of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 8 
And he shall take away all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering: _to wit_, the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is about the inwards. 

###### 9 
He shall take away also the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and upon the flanks, and the caul upon the liver with the kidneys, 

###### 10 
As it was taken away from the bullock of the peace offerings, and the Priest shall burn them upon the altar of burnt offering. 

###### 11 
But the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head, and his legs, and his inwards, and his dung _shall he bear out._ 

###### 12 
So he shall carry the whole bullock out of the host unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured, and shall burn him on the wood in the fire: where the ashes are cast out, shall he be burnt. 

###### 13 
¶ And if the whole Congregation of Israel shall sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the multitude, and have done _against_ any of the commandments of the Lord which should not be done, and have offended: 

###### 14 
When the sin which they have committed shall be known, then the Congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin, and bring him before the Tabernacle of the Congregation. 

###### 15 
And the Elders of the Congregation shall put their hands upon the head of the bullock before the Lord, and he shall kill the bullock before the Lord. 

###### 16 
Then the Priest that is anointed, shall bring of the bullock's blood into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 

###### 17 
And the Priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the Lord, _even_ before the veil. 

###### 18 
Also he shall put _some_ of the blood upon the horns of the altar, which is before the Lord, that is in the Tabernacle of the Congregation: then shall he pour all the _rest_ of the blood at the foot of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 

###### 19 
And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the altar. 

###### 20 
And _the Priest_ shall do with his bullock, as he did with the bullock for _his_ sin: so shall he do with this: so the Priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them. 

###### 21 
For he shall carry the bullock without the host, and burn him as he burned the first bullock: _for_ it is an offering for the sin of the Congregation. 

###### 22 
¶ When a ruler shall sin, and do through ignorance _against_ any of the commandments of the Lord his God, which should not be done, and shall offend, 

###### 23 
If one show unto him his sin, which he hath committed, then shall he bring for his offering an he goat without blemish, 

###### 24 
And shall lay his hand upon the head of the he goat, and kill it in the place where he should kill the burnt offering before the Lord: _for_ it is a sin offering. 

###### 25 
Then the Priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the burnt offering altar, and shall pour _the rest_ of his blood at the foot of the burnt offering altar, 

###### 26 
And shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of the peace offering: so the Priest shall make an atonement for him, concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. 

###### 27 
¶ Likewise if any of the people of the land shall sin through ignorance in doing _against_ any of the commandments of the Lord, which should not be done, and shall offend, 

###### 28 
If one show him his sin which he hath committed, then he shall bring for his offering, a she goat without blemish for his sin which he hath committed. 

###### 29 
And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of burnt offering. 

###### 30 
Then the Priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the burnt offering altar, and pour all _the rest_ of the blood thereof at the foot of the altar, 

###### 31 
And shall take away all his fat, as the fat of the peace offerings is taken away, and the Priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savor unto the Lord, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him. 

###### 32 
And if he bring a lamb for his sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish. 

###### 33 
And shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and he shall slay it for a sin offering in the place where he should kill the burnt offering. 

###### 34 
Then the Priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the burnt offering altar, and shall pour all _the rest_ of the blood thereof at the foot of the altar. 

###### 35 
And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb of the peace offerings is taken away: then the Priest shall burn it upon the altar with the oblations of the Lord made by fire, and the Priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.
