###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and say, When a woman hath brought forth seed, and borne a man-child, she shall be unclean seven days, like as she is unclean when she is put apart for her disease. 

###### 3 
(And in the eighth day the foreskin of the _children's_ flesh shall be circumcised.) 

###### 4 
And she shall continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days: she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary, until the time of her purifying be out. 

###### 5 
But if she bear a maid-child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as when she hath her disease: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days. 

###### 6 
Now when the days of her purifying are out (whether it be for a son or for a daughter) she shall bring to the Priest a lamb of one year old for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon or a turtledove for a sin offering, unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, 

###### 7 
Who shall offer it before the Lord, and make an atonement for her: so she shall be purged of the issue of her blood: this is the law for her that hath borne a male or female. 

###### 8 
But if she be not able to bring a lamb, she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons: the one for a burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the Priest shall make an atonement for her: so she shall be clean.
