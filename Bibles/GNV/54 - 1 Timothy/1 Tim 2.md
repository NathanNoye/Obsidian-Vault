###### 1 
I Exhort therefore, that first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, _and_ giving of thanks be made for all men, 

###### 2 
For Kings, and for all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and a peaceable life, in all godliness, and honesty. 

###### 3 
For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior. 

###### 4 
Who will that all men shall be saved, and come unto the acknowledging of the truth. 

###### 5 
For there is one God, and one Mediator between God and man, _which is_ the man Christ Jesus, 

###### 6 
Who gave himself a ransom for all men, _to be_ that testimony in due time, 

###### 7 
Whereunto I am ordained a preacher and an Apostle (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not) _even _a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity. 

###### 8 
I will therefore that the men pray, everywhere lifting up pure hands without wrath, or doubting. 

###### 9 
Likewise also the women, that they array themselves in comely apparel, with shamefastness and modesty, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly apparel, 

###### 10 
But (as becometh women that profess the fear of God) with good works. 

###### 11 
Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection. 

###### 12 
I permit not a woman to teach, neither to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence. 

###### 13 
For Adam was first formed, then Eve. 

###### 14 
And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived, and was in the transgression. 

###### 15 
Notwithstanding, through bearing of children she shall be saved, if they continue in faith, and love, and holiness with modesty.
