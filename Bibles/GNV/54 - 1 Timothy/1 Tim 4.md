###### 1 
Now the Spirit speaketh evidently, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, and shall give heed unto spirits of error, and doctrines of devils, 

###### 2 
Which speak lies through hypocrisy, and have their consciences burned with an hot iron, 

###### 3 
Forbidding to marry, _and commanding_ to abstain from meats which God hath created to be received with giving thanks of them which believe and know the truth. 

###### 4 
For every creature of God _is_ good, and nothing _ought_ to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving. 

###### 5 
For it is sanctified by the word of God, and prayer. 

###### 6 
If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, which hast been nourished up in the words of faith, and of good doctrine which thou hast continually followed. 

###### 7 
But cast away profane, and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself unto godliness. 

###### 8 
For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, which hath the promise of the life present, and of that that is to come. 

###### 9 
This _is_ a true saying, and by all means worthy to be received. 

###### 10 
For therefore we labor and are rebuked, because we trust in the living God, which is the Savior of all men, specially of those that believe. 

###### 11 
These things warn and teach. 

###### 12 
Let no man despise thy youth, but be unto them that believe, an ensample, in word, in conversation, in love, in spirit, in faith _and_ in pureness. 

###### 13 
Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, _and_ to doctrine. 

###### 14 
Despise not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the company of the Eldership. 

###### 15 
These things exercise, _and_ give thyself unto them, that it may be seen how thou profitest among all men. 

###### 16 
Take heed unto thyself, and unto learning: continue therein: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
