###### 1 
This _is_ a true saying, If any man desire the office of a Bishop, he desireth a worthy work. 

###### 2 
A Bishop therefore must be unreproveable, the husband of one wife, watching, temperate, modest, harborous, apt to teach, 

###### 3 
Not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre, but gentle, no fighter, not covetous. 

###### 4 
One that can rule his own house honestly, having children under obedience with all honesty. 

###### 5 
For if any cannot rule his own house, how shall he care for the Church of God? 

###### 6 
He may not be a young scholar, lest he being puffed up fall into the condemnation of the devil. 

###### 7 
He must also be well reported of, even of them which are without, lest he fall into rebuke, and the snare of the devil. 

###### 8 
Likewise _must_ Deacons _be_ grave, not double tongued, not given unto much wine, neither to filthy lucre, 

###### 9 
Having the mystery of the faith in pure conscience. 

###### 10 
And let them first be proved, then let them minister, if they be found blameless. 

###### 11 
Likewise their wives _must be_ honest, not evil speakers, _but_ sober, _and_ faithful in all things. 

###### 12 
Let the Deacons be the husbands of one wife, and such as can rule their children well, and their own households. 

###### 13 
For they that have ministered well, get themselves a good decree, and great liberty in the faith, which is in Christ Jesus. 

###### 14 
These things write I unto thee, trusting to come very shortly unto thee. 

###### 15 
But if I tarry long, that thou mayest yet know, how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the Church of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth. 

###### 16 
And without controversy, great is the mystery of godliness, _which is_, God is manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, _and_ received up in glory.
