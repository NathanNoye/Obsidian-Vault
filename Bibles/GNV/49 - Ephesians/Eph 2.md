###### 1 
And you _hath he quickened_, that were dead in trespasses and sins, 

###### 2 
Wherein, in times past ye walked, according to the course of this world, _and_ after the prince that ruleth in the air, even the spirit, that now worketh in the children of disobedience, 

###### 3 
Among whom we also had our conversation in time past in the lusts of our flesh, in fulfilling the will of the flesh, and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, as well as others. 

###### 4 
But God which is rich in mercy, through his great love wherewith he loved us, 

###### 5 
Even when we were dead by sins, hath quickened us together in Christ, _by whose_ grace ye are saved, 

###### 6 
And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly _places_ in Christ Jesus, 

###### 7 
That he might show in the ages to come the exceeding riches of his grace through his kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. 

###### 8 
For by grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: _it is_ the gift of God, 

###### 9 
Not of works, lest any man should boast himself. 

###### 10 
For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath ordained, that we should walk in them. 

###### 11 
Wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh,_ and_ called uncircumcision of them, which are called circumcision in the flesh, made with hands, 

###### 12 
That ye were, _I say_, at that time without Christ, and were aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and were strangers from the covenants of promise, and had no hope, and _were_ without God in the world. 

###### 13 
But now in Christ Jesus, ye which once were far off, are made near by the blood of Christ. 

###### 14 
For he is our peace, which hath made of both one, and hath broken the stop of the partition wall, 

###### 15 
In abrogating through his flesh the hatred, _that is_, the Law of commandments _which standeth_ in ordinances, for to make of twain one new man in himself, _so_ making peace, 

###### 16 
And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by _his_ cross, and slay hatred thereby, 

###### 17 
And came, and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were near. 

###### 18 
For through him we both have an entrance unto the Father by one Spirit. 

###### 19 
Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners: but citizens with the Saints, and of the household of God. 

###### 20 
And are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone, 

###### 21 
In whom all the building coupled together, groweth unto an holy Temple in the Lord. 

###### 22 
In whom ye also are built together to be the habitation of God by the Spirit.
