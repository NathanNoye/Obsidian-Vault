###### 1 
Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the Saints, which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus: 

###### 2 
Grace _be_ with you, and peace from God our Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 3 
Blessed _be_ God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which hath blessed us, with all spiritual blessing in heavenly things in Christ, 

###### 4 
As he hath chosen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in love: 

###### 5 
Who hath predestinated us, to be adopted through Jesus Christ in himself, according to the good pleasure of his will. 

###### 6 
To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherewith he hath made us freely accepted in _his_ beloved. 

###### 7 
By whom we have redemption through his blood, _even_ the forgiveness of sins, according to his rich grace: 

###### 8 
Whereby he hath been abundant toward us in all wisdom and understanding, 

###### 9 
And hath opened unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in him, 

###### 10 
That in the dispensation of the fullness of the times, he might gather together in one all things, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth, _even_ in Christ: 

###### 11 
In whom also we are chosen when we were predestinated according to the purpose of him, which worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, 

###### 12 
That we, which first trusted in Christ, should be unto the praise of his glory: 

###### 13 
In whom also ye _have trusted_, after that ye heard the word of truth, _even_ the Gospel of your salvation, wherein also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise, 

###### 14 
Which is the earnest of our inheritance, for the redemption of that liberty purchased unto the praise of his glory. 

###### 15 
Therefore also after that I heard of the faith, which ye have in the Lord Jesus, and love toward all the Saints, 

###### 16 
I cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers, 

###### 17 
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, that Father of glory, might give unto you the Spirit of wisdom, and revelation through the knowledge of him, 

###### 18 
That the eyes of your understanding may be lightened, that ye may know what the hope is of his calling, and what the riches of his glorious inheritance _is_ in the Saints, 

###### 19 
And what is the exceeding greatness of his power toward us, which believe, according to the working of his mighty power, 

###### 20 
Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his right hand in the heavenly _places_, 

###### 21 
Far above all principality, and power, and might, and domination, and every Name, that is named, not in this world only, but also in that that is to come, 

###### 22 
And hath made all things subject under his feet, and hath given him over all things _to be _the head to the Church, 

###### 23 
Which is his body, _even_ the fullness of him that filleth all in all things.
