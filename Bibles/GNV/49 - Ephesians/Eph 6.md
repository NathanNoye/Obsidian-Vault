###### 1 
Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right. 

###### 2 
Honor thy father and mother (which is the first commandment with promise) 

###### 3 
That it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on earth. 

###### 4 
And ye, fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in instruction and information of the Lord. 

###### 5 
Servants, be obedient unto them that are_ your_ masters, according to the flesh, with fear and trembling in singleness of your hearts, as unto Christ, 

###### 6 
Not with service to the eye, as men pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart. 

###### 7 
With good will, serving the Lord, and not men. 

###### 8 
And know ye that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, that same shall he receive of the Lord, whether _he be_ bond or free, 

###### 9 
And ye masters, do the same things unto them, putting away threatening: and know that even your master also is in heaven, neither is there respect of person with him. 

###### 10 
¶ Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might. 

###### 11 
Put on the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to stand against the assaults of the devil. 

###### 12 
For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, _and_ against the worldly governors, _the princes_ of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness, _which are_ in the high places. 

###### 13 
For this cause take unto you the whole armor of God, that ye may be able to resist in the evil day, and having finished all things, stand fast. 

###### 14 
Stand therefore, and your loins girded about with verity, and having on the breastplate of righteousness, 

###### 15 
And your feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of peace. 

###### 16 
Above all, take the shield of Faith, wherewith ye may quench all the fiery darts of the wicked, 

###### 17 
And take the helmet of Salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. 

###### 18 
And pray always with all manner prayer and supplication in the spirit: and watch thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all Saints, 

###### 19 
And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to publish the secret of the Gospel, 

###### 20 
Whereof I am the ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak. 

###### 21 
¶ But that ye may also know mine affairs, _and_ what I do, Tychicus _my_ dear brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall show you of all things. 

###### 22 
Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know mine affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts. 

###### 23 
Peace _be_ with the brethren, and love with faith from God the Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 24 
Grace _be_ with all them which love our Lord Jesus Christ, to _their_ immortality, Amen. ¶ Written from Rome unto the Ephesians, _and sent_ by Tychicus.
