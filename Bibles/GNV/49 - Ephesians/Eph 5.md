###### 1 
Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children, 

###### 2 
And walk in love, even as Christ hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, _to be_ an offering and a sacrifice of a sweet smelling savor to God. 

###### 3 
But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as it becometh Saints, 

###### 4 
Neither filthiness, neither foolish talking, neither jesting, which are things not comely, but rather giving of thanks. 

###### 5 
For this ye know, that no whoremonger, neither unclean person, nor covetous person, which is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God. 

###### 6 
Let no man deceive you with vain words: for, for such things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. 

###### 7 
Be not therefore companions with them. 

###### 8 
For ye were once darkness, but are now light in the Lord: walk as children of light. 

###### 9 
(For the fruit of the Spirit _is_ in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.) 

###### 10 
Approving that which is pleasing to the Lord. 

###### 11 
And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but even reprove them rather. 

###### 12 
For it is shame even to speak of the things which are done of them in secret. 

###### 13 
But all things when they are reproved of the light, are manifest: for it is light that maketh all things manifest. 

###### 14 
Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and stand up from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. 

###### 15 
Take heed therefore that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, 

###### 16 
Redeeming the season: for the days are evil. 

###### 17 
Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. 

###### 18 
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess: but be fulfilled with the Spirit, 

###### 19 
Speaking unto yourselves in Psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord in your hearts, 

###### 20 
Giving thanks always for all things unto God even the Father, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 21 
Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God. 

###### 22 
¶Wives, submit yourselves unto your husbands, as unto the Lord. 

###### 23 
For the husband is the wife's head, even as Christ is the head of the Church, and the same is the Savior of _his _body. 

###### 24 
Therefore as the Church is in subjection to Christ, even so _let_ the wives _be_ to their husbands in everything. 

###### 25 
¶ Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it, 

###### 26 
That he might sanctify it, and cleanse it by the washing of water through the word, 

###### 27 
That he might make it unto himself a glorious Church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing: but that it should be holy and without blame. 

###### 28 
So ought men to love their wives, as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife, loveth himself. 

###### 29 
For no man ever yet hated his own flesh, but nourished and cherisheth it, even as the Lord _doth _the Church. 

###### 30 
For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones. 

###### 31 
For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they twain shall be one flesh. 

###### 32 
This is a great secret, but I speak concerning Christ, and concerning the Church. 

###### 33 
Therefore everyone of you, _do ye so_: let everyone love his wife, even as himself, and _let_ the wife _see_ that she fear her husband.
