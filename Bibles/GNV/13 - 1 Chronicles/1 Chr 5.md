The sons also of Reuben the eldest son of Israel (for he was the eldest, but had defiled his father's bed, _therefore_ his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, so that the genealogy is not reckoned after _his_ birthright.

For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him _came_ the prince, but the birthright _was_ Joseph's)

And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel, which dwelt in Aroer even unto Nebo and Baal Meon. 

###### 9 
Also Eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the wilderness from the river Perath: for they had much cattle in the land of Gilead. 

###### 10 
And in the days of Saul they warred with the Hagrites, which fell by their hands: and they dwelt in their tents in all the East parts of Gilead. 

###### 11 
¶ And the children of Gad dwelt over against them in the land of Bashan, unto Salcah. 

###### 12 
Joel _was_ the chiefest, and Shapham the second, but Jaanai and Shaphat _were_ in Bashan. 

###### 13 
And their brethren of the house of their fathers _were_ Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and Zia and Eber, seven.

###### 18 
¶ The sons of Reuben and of Gad, and of half the tribe of Manasseh of those that were valiant men, able to bear shield and sword, and to draw a bow exercised in war, were four and forty thousand, seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the war. 

###### 19 
And they made war with the Hagrites, with Jetur, and Naphish, and Nodab. 

###### 20 
And they were helped against them, and the Hagrites were delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for they cried to God in the battle, and he heard them, because they trusted in him. 

###### 21 
And they led away their cattle, _even_ their camels fifty thousand, and two hundred and fifty thousand sheep, and two thousand asses, and of persons an hundred thousand. 

###### 22 
For many fell down wounded, because the war _was_ of God. And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity. 

###### 23 
And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the land, from Bashan unto Baal Hermon, and Senir, and unto mount Hermon: _for_ they increased. 

###### 24 
And these were the heads of the households of their fathers, even Epher and Ishi, and Eliel and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, strong men, valiant _and_ famous, heads of the households of their fathers. 

###### 25 
But they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom God had destroyed before them. 

###### 26 
And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of Assyria, and the spirit of Tiglath-Pileser king of Assyria, and he carried them away: _even_ the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto Halah and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this day.
