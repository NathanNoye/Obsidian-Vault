###### 1 
O bloody city, it is all full of lies _and_ robbery: the prey departeth not. 

###### 2 
The noise of a whip, and the noise of the moving of the wheels, and the beating of the horses, and the leaping of the chariots. 

###### 3 
The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword, and the glittering spear, and a multitude _is_ slain, and the dead bodies _are_ many: there _is_ none end of their corpses: they stumble upon their corpses, 

###### 4 
Because of the multitude of the fornications of the harlot that is beautiful, and is a mistress of witchcraft, and selleth the people through her whoredom, and the nations through her witchcrafts. 

###### 5 
Behold, _I come_ upon thee, saith the Lord of hosts, and will discover thy skirts upon thy face, and will show the nations thy filthiness, and the kingdoms thy shame. 

###### 6 
And I will cast filth upon thee, and make thee vile, and will set thee as a gazing stock. 

###### 7 
And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee, shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is destroyed, who will have pity upon her? where shall I seek comforters for thee? 

###### 8 
Art thou better than No, _which was_ full of people? that lay in the rivers, and _had_ the waters round about it? whose ditch was the sea, _and_ her wall _was_ from the sea? 

###### 9 
Ethiopia and Egypt _were_ her strength, and there _was_ none end: Put and Lubim were her helpers. 

###### 10 
Yet was she carried away, _and_ went into captivity: her young children also were dashed in pieces at the head of all the streets: and they cast lots for her noble men, and all her mighty men were bound in chains. 

###### 11 
Also thou shalt be drunken: thou shalt hide thyself, and shalt seek help because of the enemy. 

###### 12 
All thy strong cities _shall be like_ fig trees with the first ripe figs: for if they be shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. 

###### 13 
Behold, thy people within thee _are_ women: the gates of thy land shall be opened unto thine enemies, _and_ the fire shall devour thy bars. 

###### 14 
Draw thee waters for the siege: fortify thy strongholds: go into the clay, and temper the mortar: make strong brick. 

###### 15 
There shall the fire devour thee: the sword shall cut thee off: it shall eat thee up like the locusts, _though_ thou be multiplied like the locusts, _and_ multiplied like the grasshopper. 

###### 16 
Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven: the locust spoileth and flieth away. 

###### 17 
Thy princes _are_ as the grasshoppers, and thy captains as the great grasshoppers which remain in the hedges in the cold day: _but_ when the sun ariseth, they flee away, and their place is not known where they are. 

###### 18 
Thy shepherds do sleep, O king of Assyria: thy strong men lie down: thy people is scattered upon the mountains, and no man gathereth _them_. 

###### 19 
There is no healing of thy wound: thy plague is grievous: all that hear the brute of thee, shall clap the hands over thee: for upon whom hath not thy malice passed continually?
