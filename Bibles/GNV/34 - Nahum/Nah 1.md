###### 1 
The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite. 

###### 2 
God _is_ jealous, and the Lord revengeth: the Lord revengeth: even the Lord of anger, the Lord will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth _wrath_ for his enemies. 

###### 3 
The Lord _is_ slow to anger, but _he is_ great in power, and will not surely clear _the wicked_: the Lord _hath_ his way in the whirlwind, and in the storm, and the clouds _are_ the dust of his feet. 

###### 4 
He rebuketh the sea, and drieth it, and he drieth up all the rivers: Bashan is wasted and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon is wasted. 

###### 5 
The mountains tremble for him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his sight, yea the world, and all that dwell therein. 

###### 6 
Who can stand before his wrath? or who can abide in the fierceness of his wrath? his wrath is poured out like fire, and the rocks are broken by him. 

###### 7 
The Lord is good _and_ as a stronghold in the day of trouble, and he knoweth them that trust in him. 

###### 8 
But passing over _as_ with a flood, he will utterly destroy the place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies. 

###### 9 
What do ye imagine against the Lord? he will make an utter destruction: affliction shall not rise up the second time. 

###### 10 
For _he shall come as_ unto thorns folden one in another, and as unto drunkards in their drunken-ness: they shall be devoured as stubble fully dried. 

###### 11 
There cometh one out of thee that imagineth evil against the Lord, _even_ a wicked counselor. 

###### 12 
Thus saith the Lord, Though they be quiet, and also many, yet thus shall they be cut off when he shall pass by: though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more. 

###### 13 
For now I will break his yoke from thee, and will burst thy bonds in sunder. 

###### 14 
And the Lord hath given a commandment concerning thee that no more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I cut off the graven, and the molten image: I will make it thy grave for thee, for thou art vile. 

###### 15 
Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that declareth, and publisheth peace: O Judah, keep thy solemn feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass through thee: he is utterly cut off.
