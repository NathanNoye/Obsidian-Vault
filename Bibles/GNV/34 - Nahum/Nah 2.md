###### 1 
The destroyer is come before thy face: keep the munition: look to the way: make _thy_ loins strong: increase _thy_ strength mightily. 

###### 2 
For the Lord hath turned away the glory of Jacob, as the glory of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out, and marred their vine branches. 

###### 3 
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet: the chariots _shall be as_ in the fire _and_ flames in the day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall tremble. 

###### 4 
The chariots shall rage in the streets: they shall run to and fro in the highways: they shall seem like lamps: they shall shoot like the lightning. 

###### 5 
He shall remember his strong men: they shall stumble as they go: they shall make haste to the walls thereof, and the defense shall be prepared. 

###### 6 
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall melt. 

###### 7 
And Huzzab _the Queen_ shall be led away captive, and her maids shall lead _her_ as with the voice of doves, smiting upon their breasts. 

###### 8 
But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away. Stand, stand, _shall they cry_: but none shall look back. 

###### 9 
Spoil ye the silver, spoil the gold: for there is none end of the store _and_ glory of all the pleasant vessels. 

###### 10 
She is empty and void and waste, and the heart melteth, and the knees smite together, and sorrow is in all loins, and the faces of them all gather blackness. 

###### 11 
Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the pasture of the lion's whelps? where the lion _and_ the lioness waked, _and_ the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid. 

###### 12 
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and worried for his lioness, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with spoil. 

###### 13 
Behold, I _come_ unto thee saith the Lord of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions, and I will cut off thy spoil from the earth, and the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.
