###### 1 
Now was there one Naaman captain of the host of the King of Aram, a great man, and honorable in the sight of his lord, because that by him the Lord had delivered the Aramites. He also was a mighty man _and_ valiant, _but_ a leper. 

###### 2 
And the Aramites had gone out by bands, and had taken a little maid of the land of Israel, and she served Naaman's wife. 

###### 3 
And she said unto her mistress, Would God my lord _were_ with the Prophet that is in Samaria, he would soon deliver him of his leprosy. 

###### 4 
And he went in, and told his lord, saying, Thus and thus saith the maid that is of the land of Israel. 

###### 5 
And the king of Aram said, Go thy way thither, and I will send a letter unto the King of Israel. And he departed, and took with him ten talents of silver, and six thousand _pieces_ of gold, and ten changes of raiments, 

###### 6 
And brought the letter to the king of Israel to this effect, Now when this letter is come unto thee, understand, that I have sent thee Naaman my servant, that thou mayest heal him of his leprosy. 

###### 7 
And when the king of Israel had read the letter, he rent his clothes, and said, Am I God to kill and to give life that he doth send to me, that I should heal a man from his leprosy? wherefore consider, I pray you, and see how he seeketh a quarrel against me. 

###### 8 
But when Elisha the man of God had heard that the King of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent unto the King, saying, Wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes? Let him come now to me, and he shall know that there is a Prophet in Israel. 

###### 9 
¶ Then Naaman came with his horses, and with his chariots, and stood at the door of the house of Elisha. 

###### 10 
And Elisha sent a messenger unto him, saying, Go and wash thee in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be cleansed. 

###### 11 
But Naaman was wroth and went away, and said, Behold, I thought with myself, He will surely come out, and stand, and call on the Name of the Lord his God, and put his hand on the place, and heal the leprosy. 

###### 12 
Are not Abanah and Pharpar, rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? may I not wash me in them, and be cleansed? so he turned, and departed in displeasure. 

###### 13 
But his servants came, and spake unto him, and said, Father, _if_ the Prophet had commanded thee a great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? how much rather then, when he saith to thee, Wash, and be clean? 

###### 14 
Then went he down, and washed himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God: and his flesh came again, like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. 

###### 15 
¶ And he turned again to the man of God, he, and all his company, and came and stood before him, and said, Behold now, I know that _there is_ no God in all the world but in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a reward of thy servant. 

###### 16 
But he said, As the Lord liveth (before whom I stand) I will not receive it. And he would have constrained him to receive it, but he refused. 

###### 17 
Moreover Naaman said, Shall there not be given to thy servant two mules' load of this earth? for thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt sacrifice nor offering unto any other god, save unto the Lord. 

###### 18 
Herein the Lord be merciful unto thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimmon, to worship there, and leaneth on mine hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon: when I do bow down, _I say_, in the house of Rimmon, the Lord be merciful unto thy servant in this point. 

###### 19 
Unto whom he said, Go in peace. So he departed from him about half a day's journey of ground. 

###### 20 
And Gehazi the servant of Elisha the man of God said, Behold, my master hath spared this Aramite Naaman, receiving not those things at his hand that he brought: As the Lord liveth, I will run after him, and take somewhat of him. 

###### 21 
So Gehazi followed speedily after Naaman. And when Naaman saw him running after him, he lighted down from the chariot to meet him, and said, Is all well? 

###### 22 
And he answered, All is well: my master hath set me, saying, Behold, there be come to me, even now from mount Ephraim two young men of the children of the Prophets: give them, I pray thee, a talent of silver, and two changes of garments. 

###### 23 
And Naaman said, Yea, take two talents: and he compelled him, and bound two talents of silver in two bags, with two changes of garments, and gave them unto two of his servants, that they might bear them before him. 

###### 24 
And when he came to the tower, he took them out of their hands, and laid them in the house, and sent away the men: and they departed. 

###### 25 
¶ Then he went in, and stood before his master. And Elisha said unto him, Whence _comest thou_, Gehazi? And he said, Thy servant went no whither. 

###### 26 
But he said unto him, Went not mine heart _with thee,_ when the man turned again from his chariot to meet thee? Is this a time to take money, and to receive garments, and olives, and vineyards, and sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and maidservants? 

###### 27 
The leprosy therefore of Naaman shall cleave unto thee, and to thy seed forever. And he went out from his presence a leper _white_ as snow.
