###### 1 
The Elders which are among you, I beseech which am also an Elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed, 

###### 2 
Feed the flock of God, which dependeth upon you, caring for it not by constraint, but willingly: not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind: 

###### 3 
Not as though ye were Lords over _God's_ heritage, but that ye may be examples to the flock. 

###### 4 
And when that chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive an incorruptible crown of glory. 

###### 5 
Likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the Elders, and submit yourselves every man, one to another: deck yourselves inwardly in lowliness of mind: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble. 

###### 6 
Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. 

###### 7 
Cast all your care on him: for he careth for you. 

###### 8 
Be sober, and watch: for your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about, seeking whom he may devour: 

###### 9 
Whom resist steadfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren which are in the world. 

###### 10 
And the God of all grace, which hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a little, make you perfect, confirm, strengthen, and establish _you_. 

###### 11 
To him _be_ glory and dominion forever and ever, Amen. 

###### 12 
By Silvanus a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, have I written briefly, exhorting and testifying how that this is the true grace of God, wherein ye stand. 

###### 13 
_The Church_ that is at Babylon elected together with you, saluteth you, and Mark my son. 

###### 14 
Greet ye one another with the kiss of love. Peace _be_ with you all which are in Christ Jesus, Amen.
