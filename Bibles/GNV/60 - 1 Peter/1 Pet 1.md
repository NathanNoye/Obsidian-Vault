###### 1 
PETER an Apostle of JESUS CHRIST, to the strangers that dwell here and there throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia and Bithynia, 

###### 2 
Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father unto sanctification of the Spirit, through obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace and peace be multiplied unto you. 

###### 3 
Blessed _be_ God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, 

###### 4 
To an inheritance immortal and undefiled, and that withereth not, reserved in heaven for us, 

###### 5 
Which are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation, which is prepared to be showed in the last time. 

###### 6 
Wherein ye rejoice, though now for a season (if need require) ye are in heaviness, through manifold tentations, 

###### 7 
That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perisheth (though it be tried with fire) might be found unto _your_ praise, and honor and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: 

###### 8 
Whom ye have not seen, and yet love _him_, in whom now, though ye see him not, yet do you believe, and rejoice with [joy] unspeakable and glorious, 

###### 9 
Receiving the end of your faith, _even_ the salvation of _your_ souls. 

###### 10 
Of the which salvation the Prophets have inquired and searched, which prophesied of the grace that should come unto you, 

###### 11 
Searching when or what time the Spirit which testified before of Christ which was in them, should declare the sufferings _that should come_ unto Christ, and the glory that should follow. 

###### 12 
Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they should minister the things, which are showed unto you by them which have preached unto you the Gospel by the holy Ghost sent down from heaven, the which things the Angels desire to behold. 

###### 13 
Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind: be sober, and trust perfectly on that grace that is brought unto you, in the revelation of Jesus Christ, 

###### 14 
As obedient children, not fashioned yourselves unto the former lusts of your ignorance: 

###### 15 
But as he which hath called you, is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation, 

###### 16 
Because it is written, Be ye holy, for I am holy. 

###### 17 
And if ye call him Father, which without respect of person judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your dwelling here in fear. 

###### 18 
Knowing that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, _as_ silver and gold, from your vain conversation, received by the traditions of the fathers, 

###### 19 
But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a Lamb undefiled, and without spot. 

###### 20 
Which was ordained before the foundation of the world, but was declared in the last times for your sakes, 

###### 21 
Which by his means do believe in God that raised him from the dead, and gave him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God. 

###### 22 
Having purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit, to love brotherly without feigning, love one another with a pure heart fervently: 

###### 23 
Being born anew, not of mortal seed, but of immortal, by the word of God, who liveth and endureth forever. 

###### 24 
For all flesh _is_ as grass, and all the glory of man _is_ as the flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower falleth away. 

###### 25 
But the word of the Lord endureth forever: and this is the word which is preached among you.
