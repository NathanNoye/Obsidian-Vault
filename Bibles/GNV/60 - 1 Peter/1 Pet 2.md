###### 1 
Wherefore, laying aside all maliciousness, and all guile, and dissimulation, and envy, and all evil speaking, 

###### 2 
As newborn babes desire that sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby, 

###### 3 
Because ye have tasted that the Lord _is_ bountiful. 

###### 4 
To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed of men, but chosen of God _and_ precious, 

###### 5 
Ye also as lively stones, be made a spiritual house, an holy Priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ. 

###### 6 
Wherefore also it is contained in the Scripture, Behold, I put in Zion a chief cornerstone, elect and precious, and he that believeth therein, shall not be ashamed. 

###### 7 
Unto you therefore which believe, it is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner, 

###### 8 
And a stone to stumble at, and a rock of offence, even _to them_ which stumble at the word, being disobedient, unto the which thing they were even ordained. 

###### 9 
But ye are a chosen generation, a royal Priesthood, an holy nation, a people set at liberty, that ye should show forth the virtues of him that hath called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, 

###### 10 
Which in time past were not a people, yet _are_ now the people of God: which in time past were not under mercy, but now have obtained mercy. 

###### 11 
Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which fight against the soul, 

###### 12 
And have your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that they which speak evil of you as of evil doers, may by _your_ good works which they shall see, glorify God in the day of visitation. 

###### 13 
Therefore submit yourselves unto all manner ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, whether it be unto the King, as unto the superior, 

###### 14 
Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent of him, for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well. 

###### 15 
For so is the will of God, that by well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men. 

###### 16 
As free, and not as having the liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. 

###### 17 
Honor all men: love brotherly fellowship: fear God: honor the King. 

###### 18 
Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and courteous, but also to the froward. 

###### 19 
For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God endure grief, suffering wrongly. 

###### 20 
For what praise is it, if when ye be buffeted for your faults, ye take it patiently? but and if when ye do well, ye suffer _wrong_ and take it patiently, this is acceptable to God. 

###### 21 
For hereunto ye are called: for Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example that ye should follow his steps, 

###### 22 
Who did no sin, neither was there guile found in his mouth. 

###### 23 
Who when he was reviled, reviled not again: when he suffered, he threatened not, but committed it to him that judgeth righteously. 

###### 24 
Who his own self bare our sins in his body on the tree, that we being dead to sin, should live in righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed. 

###### 25 
For ye were as sheep going astray: but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.
