###### 1 
Likewise let the wives be subject to their husbands, that even they which obey not the word, may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives. 

###### 2 
While they behold your pure conversation which is with fear: 

###### 3 
Whose appareling let it not be that outward, with braided hair, and gold put about, or in putting on of apparel: 

###### 4 
But let it be the hidden man of the heart, _which consisteth_ in the incorruption of a meek and quiet spirit, which is before God a thing much set by. 

###### 5 
For even after this manner in time past did the holy women, which trusted in God, tire themselves, and were subject to their husbands. 

###### 6 
As Sarah obeyed Abraham, and called him Sir: whose daughters ye are, while ye do well, not being afraid of any terror. 

###### 7 
Likewise ye husbands, dwell with them as men of knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, even as they which are heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not interrupted. 

###### 8 
Finally, be ye all of one mind: one suffer with another: love as brethren: _be_ pitiful, _be_ courteous. 

###### 9 
Not rendering evil for evil, neither rebuke for rebuke: but contrariwise bless, knowing that ye are thereunto called, that ye should be heirs of blessing. 

###### 10 
For if any man long after life, and to see good days, let him refrain his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile. 

###### 11 
Let him eschew evil and do good: let him seek peace and follow after it. 

###### 12 
For the eyes of the Lord _are_ over the righteous, and his ears _are open_ unto their prayers: and the face of the Lord _is_ against them that do evil. 

###### 13 
And who is it that will harm you, if ye follow that which is good? 

###### 14 
Notwithstanding blessed _are ye_, if ye suffer for righteousness' sake. Yea, fear not their fear, neither be troubled. 

###### 15 
But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you, with meekness and reverence. 

###### 16 
Having a good conscience, that when they speak evil of you as of evil doers, they may be ashamed which slander your good conversation in Christ. 

###### 17 
For _it is_ better (if the will of God be so) that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. 

###### 18 
For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, and was put to death concerning the flesh, but was quickened by the spirit. 

###### 19 
By the which he also went, and preached unto the spirits that _are _in prison. 

###### 20 
Which were in time passed disobedient, when once the long suffering of God abode in the days of Noah, while the Ark was preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved in the water. 

###### 21 
Whereof the baptism _that_ now _is_, answering that figure, (_which is_ not a putting away of the filth of the flesh, but a confident demanding with a good conscience maketh to God) saveth us also by the resurrection of Jesus Christ. 

###### 22 
Which is at the right hand of God, gone into heaven, to whom the Angels, and Powers, and might are subject.
