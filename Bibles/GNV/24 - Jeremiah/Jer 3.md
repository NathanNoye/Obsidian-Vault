###### 1 
They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and become another man's, shall he return again unto her? shall not this land be polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers: yet turn again to me, saith the Lord. 

###### 2 
Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and behold, where thou hast not played the harlot: thou hast sat _waiting_ for them in the ways, as the Arabian in the wilderness: and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms, and with thy malice. 

###### 3 
Therefore the showers have been restrained, and the latter rain came not, and thou haddest a whore's forehead: thou wouldest not be ashamed. 

###### 4 
Didst thou not still cry unto me, Thou art my father, _and_ the guide of my youth? 

###### 5 
Will he keep _his anger_ forever? will he reserve it to the end? thus hast thou spoken, but thou doest evil, even more and more. 

###### 6 
The Lord said also unto me, in the days of Josiah the King, Hast thou seen what this rebel Israel hath done? _for_ she hath gone up upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and there played the harlot. 

###### 7 
And I said, when she had done all this, Turn thou unto me: but she returned not, as her rebellious sister Judah saw. 

###### 8 
When I saw, how that by all occasions rebellious Israel had played the harlot, I cast her away, and gave her a bill of divorcement: yet her rebellious sister Judah was not afraid, but she went also and played the harlot. 

###### 9 
So that for the lightness of her whoredom she hath even defiled the land: for she hath committed fornication with stones and stocks. 

###### 10 
Nevertheless for all this, her rebellious sister Judah hath not returned unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the Lord. 

###### 11 
And the Lord said unto me, The rebellious Israel hath justified herself more than the rebellious Judah. 

###### 12 
Go and cry these words toward the North, and say, Thou disobedient Israel, return, saith the Lord, _and_ I will not let my wrath fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not always keep _mine anger_. 

###### 13 
But know thine iniquity: for thou hast rebelled against the Lord thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strange _gods_ under every green tree, but ye would not obey my voice, saith the Lord. 

###### 14 
O ye disobedient children, turn again, saith the Lord, for I am your Lord, and I will take you one of a city, and two of a tribe, and will bring you to Zion, 

###### 15 
And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. 

###### 16 
Moreover, when ye be increased and multiplied in the land, in those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more, The Ark of the covenant of the Lord: for it shall come no more to mind, neither shall they remember it, neither shall they visit it, for that shall be no more done. 

###### 17 
At that time they shall call Jerusalem, The throne of the Lord, and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, _even_ to the Name of the Lord in Jerusalem: and thence forth they shall follow no more the hardness of their wicked heart. 

###### 18 
In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the North, into the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers. 

###### 19 
But I said, How did I take thee for children, and give thee a pleasant land, _even_ the glorious heritage of the armies of the heathen, and say, Thou shalt call me, _saying_, My father, and shall not turn from me? 

###### 20 
But _as_ a woman rebelleth against her husband: so have ye rebelled against me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord. 

###### 21 
A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping, and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, _and_ forgotten the Lord their God. 

###### 22 
O ye disobedient children, return _and_ I will heal your rebellions. Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God. 

###### 23 
Truly _the hope_ of the hills _is_ but vain, _nor_ the multitude of mountains: but in the Lord our God is the health of Israel. 

###### 24 
For confusion hath devoured our father's labor, from our youth, their sheep and their bullocks, their sons and their daughters. 

###### 25 
We lie down in our confusion, and our shame covereth us: for we have sinned against the Lord our God, we and our fathers from our youth, even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God.
