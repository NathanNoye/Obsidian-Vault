###### 1 
Then said the Lord unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, _yet_ mine affection could not be toward this people: cast _them_ out of my sight, and let them depart. 

###### 2 
And if they say unto thee, Whither shall we depart? then tell them, Thus saith the Lord, Such as are _appointed_ to death, unto death: and such as are for the sword, to the sword: and such as are for the famine, to the famine: and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. 

###### 3 
And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the Lord, the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear in pieces, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth to devour, and to destroy. 

###### 4 
I will scatter them also in all kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the son of Hezekiah King of Judah for that which he did in Jerusalem. 

###### 5 
Who shall then have pity upon thee, O Jerusalem? or who shall be sorry for thee? or who shall go to pray for thy peace? 

###### 6 
Thou hast forsaken me, saith the Lord, _and_ gone backward: therefore will I stretch out mine hand against thee, and destroy thee: _for_ I am weary with repenting. 

###### 7 
And I will scatter them with the fan in the gates of the earth: I have wasted, _and_ destroyed my people, _yet_ they would not return from their ways. 

###### 8 
Their widows are increased by me above the sand of the sea: I have brought upon them, _and_ against the assembly of the young men, a destroyer at noon day: I have caused _him_ to fall upon them, _and_ the city, suddenly and speedily. 

###### 9 
She that hath borne seven, hath been made weak: her heart hath failed: the sun hath failed her, while it was day, she hath been confounded, and ashamed, and the residue of them will I deliver unto the sword before their enemies, saith the Lord. 

###### 10 
¶ Woe is me, my mother, that thou hast borne me, a contentious man, and a man that striveth with the whole earth: I have neither lent on usury, nor men have lent unto me on usury: _yet_ everyone doth curse me. 

###### 11 
The Lord said, Surely thy remnant shall have wealth: surely I will cause thine enemy to entreat thee in the time of trouble, and in the time of affliction. 

###### 12 
Shall the iron break the iron, and the brass _that cometh_ from the North? 

###### 13 
Thy substance and thy treasures will I give to be spoiled without gain, and that for all thy sins even in all thy borders. 

###### 14 
And I will make thee to go with thine enemies into a land that thou knowest not, for a fire is kindled in mine anger, _which_ shall burn you. 

###### 15 
O Lord, thou knowest, remember me, and visit me, and revenge me of my persecutors: take me not away in the continuance of thine anger: know that for thy sake I have suffered rebuke. 

###### 16 
Thy words were found _by me_, and I did eat them, and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart: for thy Name is called upon me, O Lord God of hosts. 

###### 17 
I sat not in the assembly of the mockers, neither did I rejoice, but sat alone because of thy plague: for thou hast filled me with indignation. 

###### 18 
Why is mine heaviness continual? and my plague desperate _and_ cannot be healed, _why_ art thou unto me as a liar, _and as _waters that fail? 

###### 19 
Therefore thus saith the Lord, If thou return, then will I bring thee again, _and_ thou shalt stand before me: and if thou take away the precious from the vile, thou shalt be according to my word: let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them. 

###### 20 
And I will make thee unto this people a strong brazen wall, and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee, saith the Lord. 

###### 21 
And I will deliver thee out of the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee out of the hand of the tyrants.
