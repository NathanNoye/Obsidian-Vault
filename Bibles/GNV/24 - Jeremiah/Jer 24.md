###### 1 
The Lord showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before the Temple of the Lord, after that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babel had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, and the princes of Judah with the workmen, and cunning men of Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babel. 

###### 2 
One basket _had_ very good figs, _even_ like the figs that are first _ripe_, and the other basket _had_ very naughty figs, which could not be eaten, they were so evil. 

###### 3 
Then said the Lord unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I said, Figs: the good figs very good, and the naughty very naughty, which cannot be eaten, they are so evil. 

###### 4 
Again the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 5 
Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, Like these good figs, so will I know them that are carried away captive of Judah to be good, whom I have sent out of this place, into the land of the Chaldeans. 

###### 6 
For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land, and I will build them and not destroy them, and I will plant them, and not root them out. 

###### 7 
And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart. 

###### 8 
And as the naughty figs which cannot be eaten, they are so evil (surely thus saith the Lord) so will I give Zedekiah the King of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: 

###### 9 
I will even give them for a terrible plague to all the kingdoms of the earth, _and_ for a reproach and for a proverb, for a common talk, and for a curse, in all places where I shall cast them. 

###### 10 
And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence among them, till they be consumed out of the land, that I gave unto them, and to their fathers.
