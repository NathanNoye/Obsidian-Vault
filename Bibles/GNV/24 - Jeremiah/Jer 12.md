###### 1 
O Lord, if I dispute with thee, thou art righteous: yet let me talk with thee of _thy_ judgments: wherefore doth the way of the wicked prosper? _why_ are all they in wealth that rebelliously transgress? 

###### 2 
Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root: they grow, and bring forth fruit, thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. 

###### 3 
But thou, Lord, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried mine heart toward thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. 

###### 4 
How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds, because they said, He will not see our last end. 

###### 5 
If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou match thyself with horses? and if thou thoughtest thyself safe in a peaceable land, what wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? 

###### 6 
For even thy brethren and the house of thy father, even they have dealt unfaithfully with thee, and they have cried out altogether upon thee: _but_ believe them not, though they speak fair to thee. 

###### 7 
I have forsaken mine house: I have left mine heritage: I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hands of her enemies. 

###### 8 
Mine heritage is unto me, as a lion in the forest: it crieth out against me, therefore have I hated it. 

###### 9 
Shall mine heritage be unto me, as a bird of divers colors? are not the birds about her, _saying_, Come, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to eat her? 

###### 10 
Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, and trodden my portion under foot: of my pleasant portion they have made a desolate wilderness. 

###### 11 
They have laid it waste, and it, being waste mourneth unto me, _and_ the whole land lieth waste, because no man setteth _his_ mind on it. 

###### 12 
The destroyers are come upon all the high places in the wilderness: for the sword of the Lord shall devour from the one end of the land, even to the _other_ end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. 

###### 13 
They have sown wheat, and reaped thorns: they were sick, _and_ had no profit: and they were ashamed of your fruits, because of the fierce wrath of the Lord. 

###### 14 
Thus saith the Lord against all mine evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance, which I have caused my people Israel to inherit, Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. 

###### 15 
And after that I have plucked them out, I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring again every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. 

###### 16 
And if they will learn the ways of my people, to swear by my Name, (The Lord liveth, as they taught my people to swear by Baal) then shall they be built in the midst of my people. 

###### 17 
But if they will not obey, then will I utterly pluck up, and destroy that nation, saith the Lord.
