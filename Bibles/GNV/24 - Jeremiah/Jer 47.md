###### 1 
The words of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the Prophet, against the Philistines, before that Pharaoh smote Gaza. 

###### 2 
Thus saith the Lord, Behold, waters rise up out of the North, and shall be as a swelling flood, and shall overflow the land, and all that is therein, and the cities with them that dwell therein: then the men shall cry, and all the inhabitants of the land shall howl, 

###### 3 
At the noise _and_ stamping of the hoofs of his strong _horses_, at the noise of his chariots, and at the rumbling of his wheels: the fathers shall not look back to _their_ children, for feebleness of hands, 

###### 4 
Because of the day that cometh to destroy all the Philistines, and to destroy Tyre, and Sidon, _and_ all the rest that take their part: for the Lord will destroy the Philistines, the remnant of the isle of Caphtor. 

###### 5 
Baldness is come upon Gaza: Ashkelon is cut up _with_ the rest of their valleys. How long wilt thou cut thyself? 

###### 6 
O thou sword of the Lord, how long will it be or thou cease! turn again into thy scabbard, rest and be still. 

###### 7 
How can it cease, seeing the Lord hath given it a charge against Ashkelon, and against the sea bank? even there hath he appointed it.
