###### 1 
Concerning Moab, thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Woe unto Nebo: for it is wasted: Kirjathaim is confounded _and_ taken: Misgab is confounded and afraid. 

###### 2 
Moab shall boast no more of Heshbon: _for_ they have devised evil against it. Come, and let us destroy it, that it be no more a nation: also thou shalt be destroyed, O Madmen, _and_ the sword shall pursue thee. 

###### 3 
A voice of crying _shall be_ from Horonaim _with_ desolation and great destruction. 

###### 4 
Moab is destroyed: her little ones have caused their cry to be heard. 

###### 5 
For at the going up of Luhith, the mourner shall go up with weeping: for in the going down of Horonaim, the enemies have heard a cry of destruction. 

###### 6 
Flee and save your lives, and be like unto the heath in the wilderness. 

###### 7 
For because thou hast trusted in thy works and in thy treasures, thou shalt also be taken, and Chemosh shall go forth into captivity with his Priests and his Princes together. 

###### 8 
And the destroyer shall come upon all cities, and no city shall escape: the valley also shall perish and the plain shall be destroyed as the Lord hath spoken. 

###### 9 
Give wings unto Moab, that it may flee and get away: for the cities thereof shall be desolate, without any to dwell therein. 

###### 10 
Cursed _be he_ that doeth the work of the Lord negligently, and cursed _be he_ that keepeth back his sword from blood. 

###### 11 
Moab hath been at rest from his youth, and he hath settled on his lees, and hath not been poured from vessel to vessel, neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste remained in him, and his scent is not changed. 

###### 12 
¶ Therefore behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will send unto him such as shall carry him away, and shall empty his vessels, and break their bottles. 

###### 13 
And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel their confidence. 

###### 14 
How think you _thus_, We are mighty and strong men of war? 

###### 15 
Moab is destroyed, and his cities burnt up, and his chosen young men are gone down to slaughter, saith the King, whose name _is_, The Lord of hosts. 

###### 16 
The destruction of Moab is ready to come, and his plague hasteth fast. 

###### 17 
All ye that are about him, mourn for him, and all ye that know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, _and_ the beautiful rod! 

###### 18 
Thou daughter that dost inhabit Dibon, come down from _thy_ glory, and sit in thirst: for the destroyer of Moab shall come upon thee, _and_ he shall destroy thy strongholds. 

###### 19 
Thou that dwellest in Aroer, stand by the way, and behold ask him that fleeth and that escapeth, _and_ say, What is done? 

###### 20 
Moab is confounded: for it is destroyed, howl and cry, tell ye it in Arnon, that Moab is made waste, 

###### 21 
And judgment is come upon the plain country, upon Holon and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath, 

###### 22 
And upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon the house of Diblathaim, 

###### 23 
And upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth Gamul, and upon Beth Meon, 

###### 24 
And upon Kerioth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the cities of the land of Moab far or near. 

###### 25 
The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith the Lord. 

###### 26 
Make ye him drunken: for he magnified himself against the Lord: Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall be in derision. 

###### 27 
For didst not thou deride Israel, as though he had been found among thieves? for when thou speakest of him, thou art moved. 

###### 28 
O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rocks, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth. 

###### 29 
We have heard the pride of Moab (_he is_ exceeding proud) his stoutness, and his arrogancy, and his pride, and the haughtiness of his heart. 

###### 30 
I know his wrath, saith the Lord, but it shall not _be_ so: _and _his dissimulations, _for_ they do not right. 

###### 31 
Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all Moab: _mine heart_ shall mourn for the men of Kir Heres. 

###### 32 
O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee, as I wept for Jazer: thy plants are gone over the sea, they are come to the sea of Jazer: the destroyer is fallen upon thy summer fruits, and upon thy vintage, 

###### 33 
And joy, and gladness is taken from the plentiful field, and from the land of Moab: and I have caused wine to fail from the winepress: none shall tread with shouting: _their_ shouting _shall be_ no shouting. 

###### 34 
From the cry of Heshbon unto Elealeh _and_ unto Jahaz have they made their noise: from Zoar unto Horonaim, the heifer of three years old _shall go lowing_: for the waters also of Nimrim shall be wasted. 

###### 35 
Moreover, I will cause to cease in Moab, saith the Lord, him that offereth in the high places, and him that burneth incense to his gods. 

###### 36 
Therefore mine heart shall sound for Moab like a shawm, and mine heart shall sound like a shawm for the men of Kir Heres, because the riches that he hath gotten is perished. 

###### 37 
For every head shall be bald, and every beard plucked: upon all the hands shall be cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth. 

###### 38 
_And_ mourning shall be upon all the house tops of Moab, and in all the streets thereof: for I have broken Moab like a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith the Lord. 

###### 39 
They shall howl, _saying_, How is he destroyed? how hath Moab turned the back with shame? so shall Moab be a derision, and a fear to all them about him. 

###### 40 
For thus saith the Lord, Behold, he shall flee as an eagle, and shall spread his wings over Moab. 

###### 41 
The cities are taken, and the strongholds are won, and the mighty men's hearts in Moab at that day shall be as the heart of a woman in travail. 

###### 42 
And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he hath set up himself against the Lord: 

###### 43 
Fear, and pit, and snare _shall be_ upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab, saith the Lord. 

###### 44 
He that escapeth from the fear, shall fall in the pit, and he that getteth up out of the pit, shall be taken n the snare: for I will bring upon it, _even_ upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith the Lord. 

###### 45 
They that fled, stood under the shadow of Heshbon, because of the force: for the fire came out of Heshbon, and a flame from Sihon, and devoured the corner of Moab, and the top of the seditious children. 

###### 46 
Woe _be_ unto thee, O Moab: the people of Chemosh perisheth: for thy sons are taken captives, and thy daughters _led_ into captivity. 

###### 47 
Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, saith the Lord. Thus far of the judgment of Moab.
