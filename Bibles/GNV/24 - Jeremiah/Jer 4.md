###### 1 
O Israel, if thou return, return unto me, saith the Lord: and if thou put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove. 

###### 2 
And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth in truth, in judgment and in righteousness, and the nations shall be blessed in him, and shall glory in him. 

###### 3 
For thus saith the Lord to the men of Judah, and to Jerusalem, 

###### 4 
Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among the thorns: be circumcised to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your hearts, ye men of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem, lest my wrath come forth like fire, and burn, that none can quench it, because of the wickedness of your inventions. 

###### 5 
Declare in Judah, and show forth in Jerusalem, and say, Blow the trumpet in the land: cry, and gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into strong cities. 

###### 6 
Set up the standard in Zion: prepare to flee, _and_ stay not: for I will bring a plague from the North, and a great destruction. 

###### 7 
The lion is come up from his den, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is departed, _and_ gone forth of his place to lay thy land waste, _and_ thy cities shall be destroyed without an inhabitant. 

###### 8 
Wherefore gird you with sackcloth: lament, and howl, for the fierce wrath of the Lord is not turned back from us. 

###### 9 
And in that day, saith the Lord, the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes and the Priests shall be astonished, and the Prophets shall wonder. 

###### 10 
Then said I, Ah, Lord God, surely thou hast deceived this people, and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace, and the sword pierceth unto the heart. 

###### 11 
At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind in the high places of the wilderness _cometh_ toward the daughter of my people, _but_ neither to fan nor to cleanse. 

###### 12 
A mighty wind shall come unto me from those _places_, and now will I also give sentence upon them. 

###### 13 
Behold, he shall come up as the clouds, and his chariots _shall be_ as a tempest: his horses are lighter than eagles. Woe unto us, for we are destroyed. 

###### 14 
O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved: how long shall thy wicked thoughts remain within thee? 

###### 15 
For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim. 

###### 16 
Make ye mention of the heathen, _and_ publish in Jerusalem, Behold, the scouts come from a far country, and cry out against the cities of Judah. 

###### 17 
They have compassed her about as the watchmen of the field, because it hath provoked me unto wrath, saith the Lord. 

###### 18 
Thy ways and thine inventions have procured thee these things, such is thy wickedness: therefore it shall be bitter, therefore it shall pierce unto thine heart. 

###### 19 
My belly, my belly, I am pained, even at the very heart: mine heart is troubled within me: I cannot be still: for my soul hath heard the sound of the trumpet, _and_ the alarm of the battle. 

###### 20 
Destruction upon destruction is cried, for the whole land is wasted: suddenly are my tents destroyed, _and_ my curtains in a moment. 

###### 21 
How long shall I see the standard, _and_ hear the sound of the trumpet? 

###### 22 
For my people is foolish, they have not known me: they are foolish children, and have none understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do well they have no knowledge. 

###### 23 
I have looked upon the earth, and lo, it was without form and void: and to the heavens, and they had no light. 

###### 24 
I beheld the mountains: and lo, they trembled, and all the hills shook. 

###### 25 
I beheld, and lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the heaven were departed. 

###### 26 
I beheld, and lo, the fruitful place _was_ a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by his fierce wrath. 

###### 27 
For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate: yet will I not make a full end. 

###### 28 
Therefore shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above shall be darkened, because I have pronounced it: I have thought it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it. 

###### 29 
The whole city shall flee, for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen: they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. 

###### 30 
And when thou shalt be destroyed, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with scarlet, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou paintest thy face with colors, yet shalt thou trim thyself in vain: _for_ thy lovers will abhor thee _and_ seek thy life. 

###### 31 
For I have heard a noise as of a woman travailing, or as one laboring of her first child, _even_ the voice of the daughter Zion that sigheth and stretcheth out her hands: woe is me now: for my soul fainteth because of the murderers.
