###### 1 
When Pashhur, the son of Immer, the priest, which was appointed governor in the house of the Lord, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things, 

###### 2 
Then Pashhur smote Jeremiah the Prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the Lord. 

###### 3 
And on the morning, Pashhur brought Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah unto him, The Lord hath not called thy name Pashhur, but Magor-Missabib. 

###### 4 
For thus saith the Lord, behold, I will make thee to be a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends, and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall behold it, and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babel, and he shall carry them captive into Babel, and shall slay them with the sword. 

###### 5 
Moreover, I will deliver all the substance of this city, and all the labors thereof, and all the precious things thereof, and all the treasures of the Kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, which shall spoil them, and take them away and carry them to Babel. 

###### 6 
And thou Pashhur, and all that dwell in thine house, shall go into captivity, and thou shalt come to Babel, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. 

###### 7 
O Lord, thou hast deceived me, and I am deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily: everyone mocketh me. 

###### 8 
For since I spake, I cried out of wrong, and proclaimed desolation: therefore the word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me, and in derision daily. 

###### 9 
Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak anymore in his Name. But _his word_ was in mine heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not _stay_. 

###### 10 
For I had heard the railing of many, _and_ fear on every side. Declare, _said they_, and we will declare it: all my familiars watched for mine halting, _saying_, It may be that he is deceived: so we shall prevail against him, and we shall execute our vengeance upon him. 

###### 11 
But the Lord is with me like a mighty giant: therefore my persecutors shall be overthrown, and shall not prevail, _and_ shall be greatly confounded: for they have done unwisely, _and their_ everlasting shame shall never be forgotten. 

###### 12 
But, O Lord of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for unto thee have I opened my cause. 

###### 13 
Sing unto the Lord, praise ye the Lord: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of the wicked. 

###### 14 
¶ Cursed _be_ the day wherein I was born: and let not the day wherein my mother bare me, be blessed. 

###### 15 
Cursed _be_ the man that showed my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee, and comforted him. 

###### 16 
And let that man be as the cities, which the Lord hath overturned and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon tide, 

###### 17 
Because he hath not slain me, _even_ from the womb, or that my mother might have been my grave, or her womb a perpetual conception. 

###### 18 
How is it, _that_ I came forth of the womb, to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?
