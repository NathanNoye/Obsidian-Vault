###### 1 
Oh, that mine head were _full_ of water, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people. 

###### 2 
Oh, that I had in the wilderness a cottage of wayfaring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them: for they be all adulterers, and an assembly of rebels. 

###### 3 
And they bend their tongues _like_ their bows for lies: but they have no courage for the truth upon the earth, for they proceed from evil to worse, and they have not known me, saith the Lord. 

###### 4 
Let everyone take heed of his neighbor, and trust you not in any brother: for every brother will use deceit, and every friend will deal deceitfully, 

###### 5 
And everyone will deceive his friend, and will not speak the truth: _for_ they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and take great pains to do wickedly. 

###### 6 
Thine habitation is in the midst of deceivers: because of _their_ deceit they refuse to know me, saith the Lord. 

###### 7 
Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them: for what should I _else_ do for the daughter of my people? 

###### 8 
Their tongue _is_ as an arrow shot out, _and_ speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in his heart he layeth wait for him. 

###### 9 
Shall I not visit them for these things, saith the Lord? or shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? 

###### 10 
Upon the mountains will I take up a weeping and a lamentation, and upon the fair places of the wilderness a mourning, because they are burnt up, so that none can pass through them, neither can men hear the voice of the flock: both the fowl of the air, and the beast are fled away _and_ gone. 

###### 11 
And I will make Jerusalem an heap, _and_ a den of dragons, and I will make the cities of Judah waste without an inhabitant. 

###### 12 
Who is wise to understand this? and to whom the mouth of the Lord hath spoken, even he shall declare it. Why doth the land perish, _and_ is burnt up like a wilderness, that none passeth through? 

###### 13 
And the Lord saith, because they have forsaken my Law, which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked thereafter, 

###### 14 
But have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart, and after Baal, which their fathers taught them. 

###### 15 
Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them waters of gall to drink: 

###### 16 
I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. 

###### 17 
Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Take heed, and call for the mourning women, that they may come, and send for skillful women, that they may come, 

###### 18 
And let them make haste, and let them take up a lamentation for us, that our eyes may cast out tears, and our eyelids gush out of water. 

###### 19 
For a lamentable noise is heard out of Zion, How are we destroyed, _and_ utterly confounded, for we have forsaken the land, and our dwellings have cast us out. 

###### 20 
Therefore hear the word of the Lord, O ye women, and let your ears regard the words of his mouth, and teach your daughters to mourn, and everyone her neighbor to lament. 

###### 21 
For death is come up into our windows, _and_ is entered into our palaces, to destroy the children without, and the young men in the streets. 

###### 22 
Speak, Thus saith the Lord, The carcasses of men shall lie, even as the dung upon the field, and as the handful after the mower, and none shall gather _them_. 

###### 23 
Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, nor the strong man glory in his strength, neither the rich man glory in his riches. 

###### 24 
But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me: for I am the Lord, which show mercy, judgment, and righteousness in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the Lord. 

###### 25 
Behold, the days come saith the Lord, that I will visit all them which are circumcised with the uncircumcised: 

###### 26 
Egypt and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all the utmost corners of them that dwell in the wilderness: for all _these_ nations _are_ uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel _are_ uncircumcised in the heart.
