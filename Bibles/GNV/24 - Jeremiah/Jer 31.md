###### 1 
At the same time, saith the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. 

###### 2 
Thus saith the Lord, The people which escaped the sword, found grace in the wilderness: he walketh _before_ Israel to cause him to rest. 

###### 3 
The Lord hath appeared unto me of old, _say they_: Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with mercy I have drawn thee. 

###### 4 
Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin Israel: thou shalt still be adorned with thy timbrels, and shalt go forth in the dance of them that be joyful. 

###### 5 
Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria, and the planters that plant them, shall make them common. 

###### 6 
For the days shall come, that the watchmen upon the mount of Ephraim shall cry, Arise, and let us go up unto Zion to the Lord our God. 

###### 7 
For thus saith the Lord, Rejoice with gladness for Jacob, and shout for joy among the chief of the Gentiles: publish praise and say, O Lord, save thy people, the remnant of Israel. 

###### 8 
Behold, I will bring them from the North country, and gather them from the coasts of the world, _with_ the blind and the lame among them, _with_ the woman with child, and her that is delivered also: a great company shall return hither. 

###### 9 
They shall come weeping, and with mercy will I bring them again: I will lead them by the rivers of water in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn. 

###### 10 
¶ Hear the word of the Lord, O ye Gentiles, and declare in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel, will gather him, and will keep him, as a shepherd _doth_ his flock. 

###### 11 
For the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him, that was stronger than he. 

###### 12 
Therefore they shall come, and rejoice in the height of Zion, and shall run to the bountifulness of the Lord, _even_ for the wheat and for the wine, and for the oil, and for the increase of sheep and bullocks: and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall have no more sorrow. 

###### 13 
Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young men and the old men together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and give them joy for their sorrows. 

###### 14 
And I will replenish the soul of the Priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the Lord. 

###### 15 
Thus saith the Lord, A voice was heard on high, a mourning, _and_ bitter weeping. Rachel weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. 

###### 16 
Thus saith the Lord, Refrain the voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the Lord, and they shall come again from the land of the enemy: 

###### 17 
And there is hope in thine end, saith the Lord, that _thy_ children shall come again to their own borders. 

###### 18 
I have heard Ephraim lamenting _thus_, Thou hast corrected me, and I was chastised as an untamed calf: convert thou me, and I shall be converted: for thou art the Lord my God. 

###### 19 
Surely after that I was converted, I repented, and after that I was instructed, I smote upon _my_ thigh: I was ashamed, yea, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth. 

###### 20 
Is Ephraim my dear son or pleasant child? yet since I spake unto him, I still remembered him: therefore my bowels are troubled for him. I will surely have compassion upon him, saith the Lord. 

###### 21 
Set thee up signs: make thee heaps: set thine heart toward the path and way, that thou hast walked: turn again, O virgin of Israel: turn again to these thy cities. 

###### 22 
How long wilt thou go astray, O thou rebellious daughter? for the Lord hath created a new thing in the earth: A WOMAN shall compass a man. 

###### 23 
Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, Yet shall they say this thing in the land of Judah, and in the cities thereof, when I shall bring again their captivity, The Lord bless thee, O habitation of justice _and_ holy mountain. 

###### 24 
And Judah shall dwell in it, and all the cities thereof together, the husbandmen and they that go forth with the flock. 

###### 25 
For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. 

###### 26 
Therefore I awaked and beheld, and my sleep was sweet unto me. 

###### 27 
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will sow the house of Israel, and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. 

###### 28 
And like as I have watched upon them, to pluck up and to root out, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to plague _them_, so will I watch over them, to build and to plant _them_, saith the Lord. 

###### 29 
In those days shall they say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. 

###### 30 
But everyone shall die for his own iniquity, every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. 

###### 31 
¶ Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, 

###### 32 
Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, the which my covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the Lord. 

###### 33 
But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. 

###### 34 
And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and will remember their sins no more. 

###### 35 
Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light to the day, _and_ the courses of the moon and of the stars for a light to the night, which breaketh the sea, when the waves thereof roar: his Name _is_ the Lord of hosts. 

###### 36 
If these ordinances depart out of my sight, saith the Lord, then shall the seed of Israel cease from being a nation before me, forever. 

###### 37 
Thus saith the Lord, If the heavens can be measured, or the foundations of the earth be searched out beneath, then will I cast off all the seed of Israel, for all that they have done, saith the Lord. 

###### 38 
Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Hananel, unto the gate of the corner. 

###### 39 
And the line of the measure shall go forth n his presence upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. 

###### 40 
And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields unto the brook of Kidron, _and_ unto the corner of the horsegate toward the East, _shall be_ holy unto the Lord, neither shall it be plucked up nor destroyed anymore forever.
