And they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief fathers, and said unto them, We will build with you: for we seek the Lord your God as ye _do_, and we have sacrificed unto him since the time of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, which brought us up hither. 

###### 3 
Then Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief fathers of Israel said unto them, It is not for you, but for us to build the house unto our God: for we ourselves together will build it unto the Lord God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia hath commanded us. 

###### 4 
Wherefore the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and troubled them in building.

###### 8 
Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king, in this sort. 

###### 9 
Then _wrote_ Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions Dinai, and Apharsathcai, Tarpelai, Persia, Archevai, Bablai, Shushanchai, Dehave, Elamai, 

###### 10 
And the rest of the people whom the great and noble Osnapper brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and other that are beyond the River and Cheeneth. 

###### 11 
¶ This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto King Artaxerxes, THY SERVANTS the men beyond the River and Cheeneth, _salute thee_. 

###### 12 
Be it known unto the King that the Jews, which came up from thee to us, are come unto Jerusalem (a city rebellious and wicked) and build, and lay the foundations of the walls, and have joined the foundations. 

###### 13 
Be it known now unto the king, that if this city be built, and the foundations of the walls laid, they will not give toll, tribute, nor custom: so shalt thou hinder the king's tribute. 

###### 14 
Now therefore because we have been brought up in the _King's_ palace, it was not meet for us to see the King's dishonor: for this cause have we sent and certified the King, 

###### 15 
That one may search in the book of the Chronicles of thy fathers, and thou shalt find in the book of the Chronicles, and perceive that this city is rebellious and noisome unto kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition of old time, for the which cause this city was destroyed. 

###### 16 
We certify the king _therefore_, that if this city be built, and the foundation of the walls laid, by this means the portion beyond the River shall not be thine. 

###### 17 
¶ The King sent an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that dwelt in Samaria, and unto the other beyond the River, Shelam and Cheeth. 

###### 18 
¶ The letter which ye sent unto us, hath been openly read before me, 

###### 19 
And I have commanded and they have searched, and found, that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and hath rebelled, and rebellion hath been committed therein. 

###### 20 
There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all beyond the River, and toll, tribute and custom was given unto them. 

###### 21 
Make ye now a decree that those men may cease, and that the city be not built, till I have given _another_ commandment. 

###### 22 
Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage grow to hurt the king? 

###### 23 
When the copy of king Artaxerxes's letter was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went up in all the haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and caused them to cease by force and power. 

###### 24
