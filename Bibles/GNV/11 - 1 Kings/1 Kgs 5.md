###### 1 
And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon, (for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father) because Hiram had ever loved David. 

###### 2 
And Solomon sent him to Hiram, saying, 

###### 3 
Thou knowest that David my father could not build an house unto the name of the Lord his God, for the wars which were about him on every side, until the Lord had put them under the soles of his feet. 

###### 4 
But now the Lord my God hath given me rest on every side, _so that_ there is neither adversary, nor evil to resist. 

###### 5 
And behold, I purpose to build an house unto the Name of the Lord my God, as the Lord spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whom I will set upon thy throne for thee, he shall build an house unto my Name. 

###### 6 
Now therefore command, that they hew me cedar trees out of Lebanon, and my servants shall be with thy servants, and unto thee will I give the hire for thy servants, according to all that thou shalt appoint: for thou knowest that there are none among us, that can hew timber like unto the Sidonians. 

###### 7 
¶ And when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, which hath given unto David a wise son over this mighty people. 

###### 8 
And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the things, for the which thou sentest unto me, and will accomplish all thy desire, concerning the cedar trees and fir trees. 

###### 9 
My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon to the sea: and I will convey them by sea in rafts unto the place that thou shalt show me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shalt receive them: now thou shalt do me a pleasure to minister food for my family. 

###### 10 
So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees, _even_ his full desire. 

###### 11 
And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for food to his household, and twenty measures of beaten oil. Thus much gave Solomon to Hiram year by year. 

###### 12 
¶ And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and they two made a covenant. 

###### 13 
¶ And King Solomon raised a sum out of all Israel, and the sum was thirty thousand men: 

###### 14 
Whom he sent to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by course: they were a month in Lebanon, and two months at home. And Adoniram _was_ over the sum. 

###### 15 
And Solomon had seventy thousand that bare burdens, and fourscore thousand masons in the mountain, 

###### 16 
Besides the princes, whom Solomon appointed over the work, _even_ three thousand and three hundred, which ruled the people that wrought in the work. 

###### 17 
And the King commanded them, and they brought great stones and costly stones to make the foundations of the house, _even_ hewed stones. 

###### 18 
And Solomon's workmen, and the workmen of Hiram, and the masons hewed and prepared timber and stones for the building of the house.
