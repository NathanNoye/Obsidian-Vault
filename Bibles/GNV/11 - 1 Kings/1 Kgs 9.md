###### 1 
When Solomon had finished the building of the house of the Lord, and the King's palace, and all that Solomon desired and minded to do, 

###### 2 
Then the Lord appeared unto Solomon the second time, as he appeared unto him at Gibeon. 

###### 3 
And the Lord said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this house (which thou hast built) to put my Name there forever, and mine eyes, and my heart shall be there perpetually. 

###### 4 
And if thou wilt walk before me (as David thy father walked in pureness of heart and in righteousness) to do according to all that I have commanded thee, _and_ keep my statutes, and my judgments, 

###### 5 
Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel forever, as I promised to David thy father, saying, Thou shalt not want a man upon the throne of Israel. 

###### 6 
_But_ if ye and your children turn away from me, and will not keep my Commandments, _and_ my statutes (which I have set before you) but go and serve other gods, and worship them, 

###### 7 
Then will I cut off Israel from the land, which I have given them, and the house which I have hallowed for my Name, will I cast out of my sight, and Israel shall be a proverb, and a common talk among all people. 

###### 8 
Even this high house shall be _so_: everyone that passeth by it, shall be astonied, and shall hiss, and they shall say, Why hath the Lord done thus unto this land and to this house? 

###### 9 
And they shall answer, Because they forsook the Lord their God, which brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have taken hold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them, therefore hath the Lord brought upon them all this evil. 

###### 10 
And at the end of twenty years, when Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord, and the King's palace, 

###### 11 
(_For the which_ Hiram the king of Tyre had brought to Solomon timber of Cedar and fir trees, and gold, and whatsoever he desired) then king Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. 

###### 12 
And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon had given him, and they pleased him not. 

###### 13 
Therefore he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, my brother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day. 

###### 14 
And Hiram had sent the King sixscore talents of gold. 

###### 15 
¶ And this is the cause of the tribute, why King Solomon raised tribute, _to wit_, to build the house of the Lord, and his own house, and Millo, and the wall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer. 

###### 16 
Pharaoh king of Egypt had come up, and taken Gezer, and burnt it with fire, and slew the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and gave it for a present unto his daughter Solomon's wife. 

###### 17 
(Therefore Solomon built Gezer and Beth Horon the nether, 

###### 18 
And Baalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness of the land, 

###### 19 
And all the cities of store, that Solomon had, even cities for chariots, and cities for horsemen, and _all_ that Solomon desired and would build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion) 

###### 20 
All the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel 

###### 21 
_To wit_, their children that were left after them in the land whom the children of Israel were not able to destroy, those did Solomon make tributaries unto this day 

###### 22 
But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: but they were men of war and his servants, and his princes, and his captains, and rulers of his chariots and his horsemen. 

###### 23 
These were the princes of the officers, that were over Solomon's work: _even_ five hundred and fifty, and they ruled the people that wrought in the work. 

###### 24 
¶ And Pharaoh's daughter came up from the city of David unto the house which _Solomon_ had built for her: then did he build Millo. 

###### 25 
And thrice a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings and peace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the Lord: and he burnt incense upon _the altar_ that was before the Lord, when he had finished the house. 

###### 26 
Also king Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion Geber, which is beside Elath, and the brink of the red sea, in the land of Edom. 

###### 27 
And Hiram sent with the navy, his servants, that were mariners, and had knowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon. 

###### 28 
And they came to Ophir, and fet from thence four hundred and twenty talents of gold, and brought it to king Solomon.
