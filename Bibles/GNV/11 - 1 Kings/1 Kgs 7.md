###### 1 
But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and finished all his house. 

###### 2 
He built also an house _called_ the forest of Lebanon, an hundred cubits long, and fifty cubits broad, and thirty cubits high, upon four rows of Cedar pillars: and Cedar beams _were laid_ upon the pillars. 

###### 3 
And it was covered above with cedar upon the beams, that lay on the forty and five pillars, fifteen in a row. 

###### 4 
And the windows _were_ in three rows, and window _was_ against window in three ranks. 

###### 5 
And all the doors, and the side posts _with_ the windows were foursquare, and window was over against window in three ranks. 

###### 6 
And he made a porch of pillars fifty cubits long, and thirty cubits broad, and the porch was before them, _even_ before them _were_ thirty pillars. 

###### 7 
¶ Then he made a porch for the throne, where he judged, even a porch of judgment, and it was ceiled with cedar from pavement to pavement. 

###### 8 
And in his house where he dwelt _was_ another hall more inward than the porch which was of the same work. Also Solomon made an house for Pharaoh's daughter (whom he had taken to wife) like unto this porch. 

###### 9 
All these were of costly stones, hewed by measure, _and_ sawed with saws within and without, from the foundation unto the _stones_ of an hand breadth, and on the outside to the great court. 

###### 10 
And the foundation _was_ of costly stones, _and_ great stones, _even_ of stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits. 

###### 11 
Above also _were_ costly stones squared by rule, and _boards_ of cedar. 

###### 12 
¶ And the great court round about _was_ with three rows of hewed stones, and a row of cedar beams: so _was it_ to the inner court of the house of the Lord, and to the porch of the house. 

###### 13 
¶ Then King Solomon sent, and fet _one_ Hiram out of Tyre. 

###### 14 
He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, his father being a man of Tyre, _and_ wrought in brass: he was full of wisdom, and understanding, and knowledge to work all manner of work in brass: who came to King Solomon, and wrought all his work. 

###### 15 
For he cast two pillars of brass: the height of a pillar was eighteen cubits, and a thread of twelve cubits did compass either of the pillars. 

###### 16 
And he made two chapiters of molten brass to set on the tops of the pillars: the height of one of the chapiters _was_ five cubits, and the height of the other chapiter _was_ five cubits. 

###### 17 
He made grates like network and wreathen work like chains for the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars, _even_ seven for the one chapiter, and seven for the other chapiter. 

###### 18 
So he made the pillars and two rows of pomegranates round about in the one grate to cover the chapiters that were upon the top. And thus did he for the other chapiter. 

###### 19 
And the chapiters that were on the top of the pillars _were_ after lily work in the porch, four cubits. 

###### 20 
And the chapiters upon the two pillars _had_ also above, over against the belly within the network _pomegranates_: for two hundred pomegranates were in the _two_ ranks about upon either of the chapiters. 

###### 21 
And he set up the pillars in the porch of the Temple. And when he had set up the right pillar, he called the name thereof Jachin: and when he had set up the left pillar, he called the name thereof Boaz. 

###### 22 
And upon the top of the pillars _was_ work of lilies: so was the workmanship of the pillars finished. 

###### 23 
¶ And he made a molten sea of ten cubits wide from brim to brim, round in compass, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits did compass it about. 

###### 24 
And under the brim of it _were_ knops like wild cucumbers compassing it round about, ten in one cubit, compassing the sea round about: and the two rows of knops were cast, when it was molten. 

###### 25 
It stood on twelve bulls, three looking toward the North, and three toward the West, and three toward the South, and three toward the East: and the sea _stood_ above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward. 

###### 26 
It was an handbreadth thick, and the brim thereof was like the work of the brim of a cup with flowers of lilies: it contained two thousand baths. 

###### 27 
¶ And he made ten bases of brass, one base _was_ four cubits long, and four cubits broad, and three cubits high. 

###### 28 
¶ And the work of the bases was on this manner, They had borders, and the borders _were_ between the ledges: 

###### 29 
And on the borders that were between the ledges, were lions, bulls and Cherubims: and upon the ledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and bulls, were additions made of thin work. 

###### 30 
And every base had four brazen wheels, and plates of brass: and the four corners had undersetters: under the caldron were undersetters molten at the side of every addition. 

###### 31 
And the mouth of it was within the chapiter and above _to measure_ by the cubit: for the mouth thereof _was_ round, made like a base, and it was a cubit and half a cubit: and also upon the mouth thereof _were_ graven works, whose borders _were_ foursquare, _and_ not round. 

###### 32 
And under the borders _were_ four wheels and the axletrees of the wheels _joined_ to the base: and the height of a wheel _was_ a cubit, and half a cubit. 

###### 33 
And the fashion of the wheels was like the fashion of a chariot wheel, their axletrees, and their naves and their felloes, and their spokes _were_ all molten. 

###### 34 
And four undersetters _were_ upon the four corners of one base: _and_ the undersetters thereof were of the base _itself._ 

###### 35 
And in the top of the base was a round compass of half a cubit high round about: and upon the top of the base the ledges thereof, and the borders thereof _were_ of the same. 

###### 36 
And upon the tables of the ledges thereof, and on the borders thereof he did grave Cherubims, lions and palm trees, on the side of every one, and additions round about. 

###### 37 
Thus made he the ten bases, _They_ had all one casting, one measure, _and_ one size. 

###### 38 
¶ Then made he ten cauldrons of brass, one cauldron contained forty baths, and every cauldron _was_ four cubits, one cauldron _was_ upon one base throughout the ten bases. 

###### 39 
And he set the bases, five on the right side of the house, and five on the left side of the house. And he set the sea on the right side of the house Eastward toward the South. 

###### 40 
¶ And Hiram made cauldrons, and besoms, and basins, and Hiram finished all the work that he made to King Solomon for the house of the Lord: 

###### 41 
To wit, two pillars and _two_ bowls of the chapiters that were on the top of the two pillars, and two grates to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon the top of the pillars, 

###### 42 
And four hundred pomegranates for the two grates, even two rows of pomegranates for every grate to cover the two bowls of the chapiters, that were upon the pillars, 

###### 43 
And the ten bases, and ten cauldrons upon the bases, 

###### 44 
And the sea, and twelve bulls under that sea, 

###### 45 
And pots, and besoms, and basins: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon for the house of the Lord, were of shining brass. 

###### 46 
In the plain of Jordan did the King cast them in clay between Succoth and Zaretan. 

###### 47 
And Solomon left _to weigh_ all the vessels, because of the exceeding abundance, neither could the weight of the brass be counted. 

###### 48 
So Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house of the Lord, the golden altar, and the golden table, whereon the showbread was, 

###### 49 
And the candlesticks, five at the right side, and five at the left, before the oracle of pure gold, and the flowers, and the lamps, and the snuffers of gold, 

###### 50 
And the bowls, and the hooks, and the basins, and the spoons, and the ashpans of pure gold, and hinges of gold for the doors of the house within, _even_ for the most holy place, _and_ for the doors of the house, _to wit_, of the Temple. 

###### 51 
So was finished all the work that king Solomon made for the house of the Lord, and Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated: the silver and the gold and the vessels, _and_ laid them among the treasures of the house of the Lord.
