###### 1 
Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly, 

###### 2 
And said, I cried in mine affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me: out of the belly of hell cried I, _and_ thou heardest my voice. 

###### 3 
For thou hadst cast me into the bottom in the midst of the sea, and the floods compassed me about: all thy surges, and all thy waves passed over me. 

###### 4 
Then I said, I am cast away out of thy sight: yet will I look again toward thine holy Temple. 

###### 5 
The waters compassed me about unto the soul: the depth closed me round about, and the weeds were wrapped about mine head. 

###### 6 
I went down to the bottom of the mountains: the earth with her bars was about me forever, yet hast thou brought up my life from the pit, O Lord my God. 

###### 7 
When my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came unto thee into thine holy Temple. 

###### 8 
They that wait upon lying vanities, forsake their own mercy. 

###### 9 
But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving, and will pay that that I have vowed: salvation _is_ of the Lord. 

###### 10 
And the Lord spake unto the fish, and it cast out Jonah upon the dry land.
