###### 1 
We do you also to wit, brethren, of the grace of God bestowed upon the Churches of Macedonia. 

###### 2 
Because in great trial of affliction their joy abounded, and their most extreme poverty abounded unto their rich liberality. 

###### 3 
For to _their_ power (I bear record) yea, and beyond their power they were willing. 

###### 4 
And prayed us with great instance that we would receive the grace, and fellowship of the ministering which is toward the Saints. 

###### 5 
And _this they did_, not as we looked for: but gave their own selves, first to the Lord, and _after_ unto us by the will of God, 

###### 6 
That we should exhort Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also accomplish the same grace among you also. 

###### 7 
Therefore, as ye abound in everything, in faith and word, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love towards us, _even so see_ that ye abound in this grace also. 

###### 8 
This say I not by commandment, but because of the diligence of others: therefore prove I the naturalness of your love. 

###### 9 
For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that he being rich, for your sakes became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich. 

###### 10 
And I show _my_ mind herein: for this is expedient for you, which have begun not to do only, but also to will, a year ago. 

###### 11 
Now therefore perform to do it also, that as _there was_ a readiness to will, even so ye may perform it of that which ye have. 

###### 12 
For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not. 

###### 13 
Neither _is it_ that other men should be eased and you grieved: But upon like condition, at this time your abundance _supplieth_ their lack: 

###### 14 
That also their abundance may be for your lack, that there may be equality. 

###### 15 
As it is written, He that _gathered _much, had nothing over, and he that _gathered_ little, had not the less. 

###### 16 
And thanks _be_ unto God, which had put in the heart of Titus the same care for you. 

###### 17 
Because he accepted the exhortation, yea, he was so careful that of his own accord he went unto you. 

###### 18 
And we have sent also with him the brother, whose praise _is_ in the Gospel throughout all the Churches. 

###### 19 
(And not so only, but is also chosen of the Churches to be a fellow in our journey, concerning this grace that is ministered by us unto the glory of the same Lord, and _declaration_ of your prompt mind.) 

###### 20 
Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance that is ministered by us, 

###### 21 
Providing for honest things, not only before the Lord, but also before men. 

###### 22 
And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have ofttimes proved to be diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, for the great confidence, which _I have_ in you. 

###### 23 
Whether _any do inquire_ of Titus, _he is_ my fellow and helper to you-ward: or of our brethren, they are messengers of the Churches, _and _the glory of Christ. 

###### 24 
Wherefore show toward them, and before the Churches the proof of your love, and of the rejoicing that we have of you.
