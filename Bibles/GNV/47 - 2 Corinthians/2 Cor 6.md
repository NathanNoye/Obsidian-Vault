###### 1 
So we therefore as workers together beseech _you_, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. 

###### 2 
For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succored thee: behold now the accepted time, behold now the day of salvation. 

###### 3 
We give no occasion of offence in anything, that _our_ ministry should not be reprehended. 

###### 4 
But in all things we approve ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses. 

###### 5 
In stripes, in prisons, in tumults, in labors, 

###### 6 
By watchings, by fastings, by purity, by knowledge, by long suffering, by kindness, by the holy Ghost, by love unfeigned, 

###### 7 
By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armor of righteousness on the right hand, and on the left, 

###### 8 
By honor, and dishonor, by evil report, and good report, as deceivers, and _yet_ true: 

###### 9 
As unknown, and _yet_ known: as dying, and behold, we live, as chastened, and _yet_ not killed: 

###### 10 
As sorrowing, and _yet _always rejoicing: as poor, and _yet_ making many rich: as having nothing, and _yet_ possessing all things. 

###### 11 
O Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is made large. 

###### 12 
Ye are not kept strait in us, but ye are kept strait in your own bowels. 

###### 13 
Now for the same recompense, I speak as to _my_ children, Be you also enlarged. 

###### 14 
Be not unequally yoked with the infidels: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness? 

###### 15 
And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath the believer with the infidel? 

###### 16 
And what agreement hath the Temple of God with idols? for ye are the Temple of the living God: as God hath said, I will dwell among them, and walk there: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. 

###### 17 
Wherefore come out from among them, and separate yourselves, saith the Lord, and touch none unclean thing, and I will receive you. 

###### 18 
And I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.
