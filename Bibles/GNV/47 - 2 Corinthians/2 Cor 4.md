###### 1 
Therefore, seeing that we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not: 

###### 2 
But have cast from us the cloaks of shame, and walk not in craftiness, neither handle we the word of God deceitfully: but in declaration of the truth we approve ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God. 

###### 3 
If the Gospel be then hid, it is hid to them that are lost. 

###### 4 
In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds, _that is_, of the infidels, that the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, which is the image of God, should not shine unto them. 

###### 5 
For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake. 

###### 6 
For God that commanded the light to shine out of darkness, _is he_ which hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. 

###### 7 
But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of that power might be of God, and not of us. 

###### 8 
We are afflicted on every side, yet _are we_ not in distress: we are in doubt, but yet we despair not. 

###### 9 
_We are_ persecuted, but not forsaken: cast down, but we perish not. 

###### 10 
Everywhere we bear about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life of Jesus might also be made manifest in our bodies. 

###### 11 
For we which live, are always delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh. 

###### 12 
So then death worketh in us, and life in you. 

###### 13 
And because we have the same spirit of faith, according as it is written, I believed, and therefore have I spoken, we also believe, and therefore speak, 

###### 14 
Knowing that he which hath raised up the Lord Jesus, shall raise us up also by Jesus, and shall set us with you. 

###### 15 
For all things are for your sakes, that that most plenteous grace by the thanksgiving of many, may redound to the praise of God. 

###### 16 
Therefore we faint not, but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed daily. 

###### 17 
For our light affliction which is but for a moment, causeth unto us a far most excellent _and_ an eternal weight of glory: 

###### 18 
While we look not on the things which are seen, but on the things which are not seen for the things which are seen, _are_ temporal: but the things which are not seen, _are_ eternal.
