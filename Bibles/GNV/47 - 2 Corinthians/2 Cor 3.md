###### 1 
Do we begin to praise ourselves again? or need we as some others, Epistles of recommendation unto you, or _letters _of recommendation from you? 

###### 2 
Ye are our epistle, written in our hearts, which is understood and read of all men, 

###### 3 
In that ye are manifest, to be the Epistle of Christ, ministered by us, and written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart. 

###### 4 
And such trust have we through Christ to God: 

###### 5 
Not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think anything, as of ourselves: but our sufficiency _is _of God, 

###### 6 
Who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit: for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life. 

###### 7 
If then the ministration of death _written_ with letters and engraven in stones, was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not behold the face of Moses, for the glory of his countenance (which _glory_ is gone away.) 

###### 8 
How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be more glorious? 

###### 9 
For if the ministry of condemnation _was _glorious, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory. 

###### 10 
For even that which was glorified, was not glorified in this point, _that is_, as touching the exceeding glory. 

###### 11 
For if that they should be abolished, _was_ glorious, much more shall that which remaineth be glorious. 

###### 12 
Seeing then that we have such trust, we use great boldness of speech. 

###### 13 
And _we are_ not as Moses, _which_ put a veil upon his face, that the children of Israel should not look unto the end of that which should be abolished. 

###### 14 
Therefore their minds are hardened: for until this day remaineth the same covering untaken away in the reading of the old Testament, which _veil_ in Christ is put away. 

###### 15 
But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the veil is laid over their hearts. 

###### 16 
Nevertheless when their _heart _shall be turned to the Lord, the veil shall be taken away. 

###### 17 
Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord _is_, there _is_ liberty. 

###### 18 
But we all behold as in a mirror the glory of the Lord with open face, and are changed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.
