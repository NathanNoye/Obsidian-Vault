###### 1 
But I determined thus in myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness. 

###### 2 
For if I make you sorry, who is he then that should make me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me? 

###### 3 
And I wrote this same thing unto you, lest when I came, I should take heaviness of them of whom I ought to rejoice: this confidence have I in you all, that my joy is the _joy _of you all. 

###### 4 
For in great affliction, and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears: not that ye should be made sorry, but that ye might perceive the love which I have, specially unto you. 

###### 5 
And if any hath caused sorrow, the same hath not made me sorry, but partly (lest I should more charge _him_) you all. 

###### 6 
It is sufficient unto the same man, that he was rebuked of many. 

###### 7 
So that now contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive _him_, and comfort _him_, lest the same should be swallowed up with overmuch heaviness. 

###### 8 
Wherefore, I pray you, that you would confirm your love towards him. 

###### 9 
For this cause also did I write: that I might know the proof of you, whether ye would be obedient in all things. 

###### 10 
To whom ye forgive anything, I _forgive_ also: for verily if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes _forgave I it_ in the sight of Christ, 

###### 11 
Lest Satan should circumvent us: for we are not ignorant of his enterprises. 

###### 12 
¶ Furthermore, when I came to Troas _to preach_ Christ's Gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord, 

###### 13 
I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother, but took my leave of them, and went away into Macedonia. 

###### 14 
Now thanks _be_ unto God, which always maketh us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savor of his knowledge by us in every place. 

###### 15 
For we are unto God the sweet savor of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them which perish. 

###### 16 
To the one _we are_ the savor of death, unto death, and to the other the savor of life, unto life: and who is sufficient for these things? 

###### 17 
For we are not as many, which make merchandise of the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God in the sight of God speak we in Christ.
