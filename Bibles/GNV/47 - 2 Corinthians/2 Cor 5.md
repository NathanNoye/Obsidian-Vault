###### 1 
For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be destroyed, we have a building _given_ of God, _that is_, an house not made with hands, _but _eternal in the heavens. 

###### 2 
For therefore we sigh, desiring to be clothed with our house, which is from heaven. 

###### 3 
Because that if we be clothed, we shall not be found naked. 

###### 4 
For indeed we that are in this tabernacle, sigh and are burdened because we would not be unclothed, but would be clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life. 

###### 5 
And he that hath created us for this thing, _is_ God, who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit. 

###### 6 
Therefore we are always bold, though we know that while we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord. 

###### 7 
(For we walk by faith, and not by sight.) 

###### 8 
Nevertheless, we are bold, and love rather to remove out of the body, and to dwell with the Lord. 

###### 9 
Wherefore also we covet, that both dwelling at home, and removing from home, we may be acceptable to him. 

###### 10 
For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that every man may receive the things which are _done_ in his body, according to that he hath done, whether _it be_ good or evil. 

###### 11 
Knowing therefore that terror of the Lord, we persuade men, and we are made manifest unto God, and I trust also that we are made manifest in your consciences. 

###### 12 
For we praise not ourselves again unto you, but give you an occasion to rejoice of us that ye may have _to answer_ against them, which rejoice in the face, and not in the heart. 

###### 13 
For whether we be out of our wit, _we are it_ to God: or whether we be in our right mind, _we are it_ unto you. 

###### 14 
For that love of Christ constraineth us, 

###### 15 
Because we thus judge, that if one be dead for all, then were all dead, and he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again. 

###### 16 
Wherefore, henceforth know we no man after the flesh, yea though we had known Christ after the flesh, yet not henceforth know we _him _no more. 

###### 17 
Therefore if any man _be _in Christ, _let him be_ a new creature. Old things are passed away: behold, all things are become new. 

###### 18 
And all things _are_ of God, which hath reconciled us unto himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given unto us the ministry of reconciliation. 

###### 19 
For God was in Christ, and reconciled the world to himself, not imputing their sins unto them, and hath committed to us the word of reconciliation. 

###### 20 
Now then are we ambassadors for Christ: as though God did beseech _you_ through us, we pray you in Christ's stead, that ye be reconciled to God. 

###### 21 
For he hath made him _to be_ sin for us, which knew no sin, that we should be made the righteousness of God in him.
