###### 1 
For as touching the ministering to the Saints, it is superfluous for me to write unto you. 

###### 2 
For I know your readiness of mind, whereof I boast myself of you unto them of Macedonia, _and say_, that Achaia was prepared a year ago, and your zeal hath provoked many. 

###### 3 
Now have I sent the brethren, lest our rejoicing over you should be in vain in this behalf, that ye (as I have said) be ready. 

###### 4 
Lest if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we may not say, you) should be ashamed in this my constant boasting. 

###### 5 
Wherefore, I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren to come before unto you, and to finish your benevolence appointed afore, that it might be ready, _and come_ as of benevolence, and not as of niggardliness. 

###### 6 
This yet _remember_, that he which soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth liberally, shall reap also liberally. 

###### 7 
As every man wisheth in his heart, _so let him give_, not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver. 

###### 8 
And God is able to make all grace to abound toward you, that ye always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound in every good work, 

###### 9 
(As it is written, He hath sparsed abroad and hath given to the poor: his benevolence remaineth for ever. 

###### 10 
Also he that findeth seed to the sower, will minister likewise bread for food, and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your benevolence.) 

###### 11 
That on all parts ye may be made rich unto all liberality, which causeth through us thanksgiving unto God. 

###### 12 
For the ministration of this service not only supplieth the necessities of the Saints, but also abundantly causeth many to give thanks to God, 

###### 13 
(Which by the experiment of this ministration praise God for your voluntary submission to the Gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution to them, and to all men.) 

###### 14 
And in their prayer for you, to long after you greatly, for the abundant grace of God in you. 

###### 15 
Thanks therefore _be_ unto God for his unspeakable gift.
