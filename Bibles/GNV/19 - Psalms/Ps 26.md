###### 1 
Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in mine innocency: my trust hath been also in the Lord: _therefore_ shall I not slide. 

###### 2 
Prove me, O Lord, and try me: examine my reins, and mine heart. 

###### 3 
For thy lovingkindness _is_ before mine eyes: therefore have I walked in thy truth. 

###### 4 
I have not haunted with vain persons, neither kept company with the dissemblers. 

###### 5 
I have hated the assembly of the evil, and have not companied with the wicked. 

###### 6 
I will wash mine hands in innocency, O Lord, and compass thine altar, 

###### 7 
That I may declare with the voice of thanksgiving, and set forth all thy wondrous works. 

###### 8 
O Lord, I have loved the habitation of thine house, and the place where thine honor dwelleth. 

###### 9 
Gather not my soul with the sinners, nor my life with the bloody men: 

###### 10 
In whose hand _is_ wickedness, and their right hand is full of bribes. 

###### 11 
But I will walk in mine innocency: redeem me _therefore_, and be merciful unto me. 

###### 12 
My foot standeth in uprightness: I will praise thee, O Lord, in the Congregations.
