###### 1 
Praise thou the Lord, O my soul. 

###### 2 
I will praise the Lord during my life; as long as I have any being, I will sing unto my God. 

###### 3 
Put not your trust in Princes, _nor_ in the son of man, for there is no help in him. 

###### 4 
His breath departeth, _and_ he returneth to his earth; then his thoughts perish. 

###### 5 
Blessed _is_ he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope _is_ in the Lord his God, 

###### 6 
Which made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that therein is; which keepeth _his_ fidelity forever, 

###### 7 
Which executeth justice for the oppressed, which giveth bread to the hungry; the Lord looseth the prisoners. 

###### 8 
The Lord giveth sight to the blind: the Lord raiseth up the crooked: the Lord loveth the righteous. 

###### 9 
The Lord keepeth the strangers: he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but he overthroweth the way of the wicked. 

###### 10 
The Lord shall reign forever: O Zion, thy God _endureth_ from generation to generation. Praise ye the Lord.
