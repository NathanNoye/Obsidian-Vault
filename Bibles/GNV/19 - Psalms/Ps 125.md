***


###### 1 
They that trust in the Lord, _shall be_ as mount Zion, _which_ cannot be removed, _but_ remaineth forever. 

###### 2 
_As_ the mountains _are_ about Jerusalem: so _is_ the Lord about his people from henceforth and forever. 

###### 3 
For the rod of the wicked shall not rest on the lot of the righteous, lest the righteous put forth their hand unto wickedness. 

###### 4 
Do well, O Lord, unto those that be good and true in their hearts. 

###### 5 
But these that turn aside by their crooked _ways_, them shall the Lord lead with the workers of iniquity: _but_ peace _shall be_ upon Israel.
