###### 1 
Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy. 

###### 2 
Hide me from the conspiracy of the wicked, _and_ from the rage of the works of iniquity. 

###### 3 
Which have whet their tongue like a sword, and shot _for_ their arrows bitter words: 

###### 4 
To shoot at the upright in secret: they shoot at him suddenly and fear not. 

###### 5 
They encourage themselves _in_ a wicked purpose: they commune together to lay snares privily, _and_ say, Who shall see them? 

###### 6 
They have sought out iniquities, _and_ have accomplished that which they sought out, even everyone _his_ secret _thoughts_, and the depth of his heart. 

###### 7 
But God will shoot an arrow at them suddenly: their strokes shall be _at once_. 

###### 8 
They shall cause their own tongue to fall upon them: _and_ whosoever shall see them, shall flee away. 

###### 9 
And all men shall see it, and declare the work of God, and they shall understand, what he hath wrought. 

###### 10 
_But_ the righteous shall be glad in the Lord, and trust in him: and all that are upright of heart, shall rejoice.
