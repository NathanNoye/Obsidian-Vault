###### 1 
Praise ye the Lord from the heaven: praise ye him in the high places. 

###### 2 
Praise ye him, all ye his Angels: praise him, all his army. 

###### 3 
Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise ye him all bright stars. 

###### 4 
Praise ye him heavens of heavens, and waters, that be above the heavens. 

###### 5 
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for he commanded, and they were created. 

###### 6 
And he hath established them forever and ever: he hath made an ordinance, which shall not pass. 

###### 7 
Praise ye the Lord from the earth, _ye_ dragons and all depths: 

###### 8 
Fire and hail, snow and vapors, stormy wind, which execute his word. 

###### 9 
Mountains and all hills, fruitful trees, and all cedars: 

###### 10 
Beasts and all cattle, creeping things and feathered fowls: 

###### 11 
Kings of the earth and all people, princes and all judges of the world: 

###### 12 
Young men and maidens, also old men and children: 

###### 13 
Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for his Name only is to be exalted, _and_ his praise above the earth and the heavens. 

###### 14 
For he hath exalted the horn of his people, _which is_ a praise for all his Saints, _even_ for the children of Israel, a people _that is_ near unto him. Praise ye the Lord.
