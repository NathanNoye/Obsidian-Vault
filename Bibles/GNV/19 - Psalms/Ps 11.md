###### 1 
In the Lord put I my trust; how say ye then to my soul, Flee to your mountain _as_ a bird? 

###### 2 
For lo, the wicked bend their bow, _and_ make ready their arrows upon the string, that they may secretly shoot at them which are upright in heart. 

###### 3 
For the foundations are cast down, what hath the righteous done? 

###### 4 
The Lord _is_ in his holy palace; the Lord's throne _is_ in the heaven; his eyes will consider; his eyelids will try the children of men. 

###### 5 
The Lord will try the righteous; but the wicked, and him that loveth iniquity, doth his soul hate. 

###### 6 
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and stormy tempest; _this is_ the portion of their cup. 

###### 7 
For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness: his countenance doth behold the just.
