***


###### 1 
Judge me, O God, and defend my cause against the unmerciful people: deliver me from the deceitful and wicked man. 

###### 2 
For thou art the God of my strength: why hast thou put me away? why go I so mourning, when the enemy oppressed _me_? 

###### 3 
Send thy light and thy truth: let them lead me: let them bring me unto thine holy Mountain, and to thy Tabernacles. 

###### 4 
Then will I go unto the altar of God, _even_ unto the God of my joy _and_ gladness: and upon the harp will I give thanks unto thee, O God my God. 

###### 5 
Why art thou cast down, my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me: wait on God: for I will yet give him thanks, _he is_ my present help and my God.
