###### 1 
Blessed _is_ the man that feareth the Lord, _and_ delighteth greatly in his commandments. 

###### 2 
His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed. 

###### 3 
Riches and treasures _shall be_ in his house, and his righteousness endureth forever. 

###### 4 
Unto the righteous ariseth light in darkness: _he is_ merciful and full of compassion and righteous. 

###### 5 
A good man _is_ merciful, and lendeth, _and_ will measure his affairs by judgment. 

###### 6 
Surely he shall never be moved: _but_ the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. 

###### 7 
He will not be afraid of evil tidings: _for_ his heart is fixed, _and_ believeth in the Lord. 

###### 8 
His heart is established: _therefore_ he will not fear, until he see _his desire_ upon his enemies. 

###### 9 
He hath distributed _and_ given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth forever: his horn shall be exalted with glory. 

###### 10 
The wicked shall see it, and be angry: he shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
