###### 1 
Yet my soul keepeth silence unto God; of him _cometh_ my salvation. 

###### 2 
Yet he is my strength and my salvation, _and_ my defense; _therefore_ I shall not much be moved. 

###### 3 
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be all slain; _ye shall be_ as a bowed wall, _or_ as a wall shaken. 

###### 4 
Yet they consult to cast him down from his dignity; their delight is in lies: they bless with their mouths, but curse with their hearts. Selah. 

###### 5 
Yet my soul, keep thou silence unto God: for mine hope _is_ in him. 

###### 6 
Yet is he my strength and my salvation, _and_ my defense: _therefore_ I shall not be moved. 

###### 7 
In God _is_ my salvation and my glory, the rock of my strength; in God is my trust. 

###### 8 
Trust in him always, ye people; pour out your hearts before him, _for_ God _is_ our hope. Selah. 

###### 9 
Yet the children of men _are_ vanity, the chief men _are_ liars: to lay them upon a balance they are altogether lighter than vanity. 

###### 10 
Trust not in oppression nor in robbery: be not vain: if riches increase, set not your heart thereon. 

###### 11 
God spake once or twice, I have heard it, that power _belongeth_ unto God, 

###### 12 
And to thee, O Lord, mercy: for thou rewardest everyone according to his work.
