###### 1 
God is known in Judah: his Name _is_ great in Israel. 

###### 2 
For in Salem is his Tabernacle, and his dwelling in Zion. 

###### 3 
There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah. 

###### 4 
Thou art more bright and puissant, than the mountains of prey. 

###### 5 
The stouthearted are spoiled: they have slept their sleep, and all the men of strength have not found their hands. 

###### 6 
At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast asleep. 

###### 7 
Thou, _even_ thou art to be feared; and who shall stand in thy sight, when thou art angry! 

###### 8 
Thou didst cause _thy_ judgment to be heard from heaven; _therefore_ the earth feared, and was still, 

###### 9 
When thou, O God, arose to judgment, to help all the meek of the earth. Selah. 

###### 10 
Surely the rage of man shall turn to thy praise; the remnant of the rage shalt thou restrain. 

###### 11 
Vow and perform unto the Lord your God, all _ye_ that be round about him; let them bring presents unto him that ought to be feared. 

###### 12 
He shall cut off the spirit of princes; he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
