###### 1 
Is it true? O congregation, speak ye justly? O sons of men judge ye uprightly? 

###### 2 
Yea, rather ye imagine mischief in _your_ heart: your hands execute cruelty upon the earth. 

###### 3 
The wicked are strangers from the womb: _even_ from the belly have they erred, and speak lies. 

###### 4 
Their poison is even like the poison of a serpent; like the deaf adder _that_ stoppeth his ear. 

###### 5 
Which heareth not the voice of the enchanter, though he be most expert in charming. 

###### 6 
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouths: break the jaws of the young lions, O Lord. 

###### 7 
Let them melt like the waters, let them pass away; when he shooteth his arrows, _let them be_ as broken. 

###### 8 
Let them consume like a snail that melteth, _and like_ the untimely fruit of a woman, _that_ hath not seen the sun. 

###### 9 
As raw flesh before your pots feel _the fire_ of thorns: _so_ let them carry them away as with a whirlwind in _his_ wrath. 

###### 10 
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance; he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked. 

###### 11 
And men shall say, Verily there is fruit for the righteous; doubtless there is a God that judgeth in the earth.
