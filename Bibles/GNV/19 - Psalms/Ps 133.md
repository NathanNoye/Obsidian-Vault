###### 1 
Behold, how good and how comely a thing it is, brethren to dwell even together. 

###### 2 
_It is_ like to the precious ointment upon the head, that runneth down upon the beard, _even_ unto Aaron's beard, which went down on the border of his garments, 

###### 3 
_And_ as the dew of Hermon which falleth upon the mountains of Zion: for there the Lord appointed the blessing _and_ life forever.
