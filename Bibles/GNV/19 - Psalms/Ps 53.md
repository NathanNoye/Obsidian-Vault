###### 1 
The fool hath said in his heart, _There is_ no God, they have corrupted and done abominable wickedness, _there is_ none that doeth good. 

###### 2 
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that would understand and seek God. 

###### 3 
Everyone is gone back: they are altogether corrupt: there is none that doeth good, no not one. 

###### 4 
Do not the workers of iniquity know that they eat up my people _as_ they eat bread? they call not upon God. 

###### 5 
There they were afraid for fear, _where_ no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that besieged thee: thou hast put them to confusion, because God hath cast them off. 

###### 6 
Oh give salvation unto Israel out of Zion: when God turneth the captivity of his people, _then_ Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
