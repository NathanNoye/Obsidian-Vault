***


###### 1 
I lift up mine eyes to thee, that dwellest in the heavens. 

###### 2 
Behold, as the eyes of servants _look_ unto the hand of their masters, _and_ as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress: so our eyes _wait_ upon the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us. 

###### 3 
Have mercy unto us, O Lord, have mercy upon us: for we have suffered too much contempt. 

###### 4 
Our soul is filled too full of the mocking of the wealthy, _and_ of the despitefulness of the proud.
