###### 1 
By the rivers of Babel we sat, and there we wept, when we remembered Zion. 

###### 2 
We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof. 

###### 3 
Then they that led us captive, required of us songs and mirth, when we had hanged up _our harps, saying_, Sing us _one_ of the songs of Zion. 

###### 4 
How shall we sing, _said we_, a song of the Lord in a strange land? 

###### 5 
If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget _to play_. 

###### 6 
If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: _yea_, if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chief joy. 

###### 7 
Remember the children of Edom, O Lord, in the day of Jerusalem, which said, Raze it, raze it to the foundation thereof. 

###### 8 
O daughter of Babel, worthy to be destroyed, blessed _shall he be_ that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us. 

###### 9 
Blessed _shall he be_ that taketh and dasheth thy children against the stones.
