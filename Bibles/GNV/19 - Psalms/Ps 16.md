###### 1 
Preserve me, O GOD: for in thee do I trust. 

###### 2 
_O my soul_, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord: my well doing _extendeth_ not to thee, 

###### 3 
_But_ to the Saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent: all my delight is in them. 

###### 4 
The sorrows of them, that offer to another _god_, shall be multiplied: their offerings of blood will I not offer, neither make mention of their names with my lips. 

###### 5 
The Lord _is_ the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou shalt maintain my lot. 

###### 6 
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places: yea, I have a fair heritage. 

###### 7 
I will praise the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also teach me in the nights. 

###### 8 
I have set the Lord always before me: for he is at my right hand: _therefore_ I shall not slide. 

###### 9 
Wherefore mine heart is glad, and my tongue rejoiceth: my flesh also doth rest in hope. 

###### 10 
For thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave: neither wilt thou suffer thine holy One to see corruption. 

###### 11 
Thou wilt show me the path of life: in thy presence _is_ the fullness of joy: _and_ at thy right hand there _are_ pleasures forevermore.
