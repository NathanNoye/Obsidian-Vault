###### 1 
O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chastise me in thy wrath. 

###### 2 
Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak: O Lord heal me, for my bones are vexed. 

###### 3 
My soul is also sore troubled: but Lord, how long wilt thou delay? 

###### 4 
Return, O Lord: deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy's sake. 

###### 5 
For in death _there is_ no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall praise thee? 

###### 6 
I fainted in my mourning: I cause my bed every night to swim, _and_ water my couch with my tears. 

###### 7 
Mine eye is dimmed for despite, and sunk in because of all mine enemies. 

###### 8 
Away from me all ye workers of iniquity: for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. 

###### 9 
The Lord hath heard my petition: the Lord will receive my prayer. 

###### 10 
All mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed: they shall be turned back, _and_ put to shame suddenly.
