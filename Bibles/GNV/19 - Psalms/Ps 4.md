***


###### 1 
Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast set me at liberty, _when I was_ in distress: have mercy upon me, and hearken unto my prayer. 

###### 2 
O ye sons of men, how long _will ye turn_ my glory into shame, loving vanity, _and_ seeking lies? Selah. 

###### 3 
For be ye sure that the Lord hath chosen to himself a godly man, the Lord will hear when I call unto him. 

###### 4 
Tremble and sin not: examine your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah. 

###### 5 
Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and trust in the Lord. 

###### 6 
Many say, Who will show us _any_ good? _but_ Lord, lift up the light of thy countenance upon us. 

###### 7 
Thou hast given me more joy of heart, than _they have had_, when their wheat and their wine did abound. 

###### 8 
I will lay me down, and also sleep in peace: for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety.
