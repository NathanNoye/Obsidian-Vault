###### 1 
Hear my cry, O God: give ear unto my prayer. 

###### 2 
From the ends of the earth will I cry unto thee: when mine heart is oppressed, bring me upon the rock that is higher than I. 

###### 3 
For thou hast been my hope, _and_ a strong tower against the enemy. 

###### 4 
I will dwell in thy Tabernacle forever, _and_ my trust shall be under the covering of thy wings. Selah. 

###### 5 
For thou, O God, hast heard my desires; thou hast given an heritage unto those that fear thy Name. 

###### 6 
Thou shalt give the King a long life; his years _shall be_ as many ages. 

###### 7 
He shall dwell before God forever; prepare mercy and faithfulness, _that_ they may preserve him. 

###### 8 
So will I always sing praise unto thy Name, in performing daily my vows.
