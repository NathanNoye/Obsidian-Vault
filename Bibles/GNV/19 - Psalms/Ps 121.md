***


###### 1 
I will lift up mine eyes unto the mountains, from whence my help shall come. 

###### 2 
Mine help _cometh_ from the Lord, which hath made the heaven and the earth. 

###### 3 
He will not suffer thy foot to slip: _for_ he that keepeth thee, will not slumber. 

###### 4 
Behold, he that keepeth Israel, will neither slumber nor sleep. 

###### 5 
The Lord _is_ thy keeper: the Lord _is_ thy shadow at thy right hand. 

###### 6 
The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. 

###### 7 
The Lord shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall keep thy soul. 

###### 8 
The Lord shall preserve thy going out, and thy coming in from henceforth and forever.
