###### 1 
How long wilt thou forget me, O Lord, forever? how long wilt thou hide thy face from me? 

###### 2 
How long shall I take counsel within myself _having_ weariness daily in mine heart? how long shall mine enemy be exalted above me? 

###### 3 
Behold, _and_ hear me, O Lord my God: lighten mine eyes, that I sleep not in death. 

###### 4 
Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him: _and_ they that afflict me, rejoice, when I slide. 

###### 5 
But I trust in thy mercy: mine heart shall rejoice in thy salvation; I will sing to the Lord, because he hath dealt lovingly with me.
