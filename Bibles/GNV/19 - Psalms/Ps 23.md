###### 1 
The Lord _is_ my shepherd, I shall not want. 

###### 2 
He maketh me to rest in green pasture, _and_ leadeth me by the still waters. 

###### 3 
He restoreth my soul, _and_ leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his Name's sake. 

###### 4 
Yea, though I should walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. 

###### 5 
Thou dost prepare a table before me in the sight of mine adversaries: thou dost anoint mine head with oil, _and_ my cup runneth over. 

###### 6 
Doubtless kindness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall remain a long season in the house of the Lord.
