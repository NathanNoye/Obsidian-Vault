###### 1 
O God, thou art my God, early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee: my flesh longeth greatly after thee in a barren and dry land without water: 

###### 2 
Thus I behold thee _as_ in the Sanctuary, when I behold thy power and thy glory. 

###### 3 
For thy loving-kindness _is_ better than life: _therefore_ my lips shall praise thee. 

###### 4 
Thus will I magnify thee _all_ my life, _and_ lift up mine hands in thy Name. 

###### 5 
My soul shall be satisfied, as with marrow and fatness, and my mouth shall praise _thee_ with joyful lips, 

###### 6 
When I remember thee on my bed, _and when_ I think upon thee in the _night_ watches. 

###### 7 
Because thou hast been mine helper, therefore under the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice. 

###### 8 
My soul cleaveth unto thee: _for_ thy right hand upholdeth me. 

###### 9 
Therefore they that seek my soul to destroy it, they shall go into the lowest parts of the earth. 

###### 10 
They shall cast him down with the edge of the sword, _and_ they shall be a portion for foxes. 

###### 11 
But the king shall rejoice in God, _and_ all that swear by him shall rejoice _in him_: for the mouth of them that speak lies, shall be stopped.
