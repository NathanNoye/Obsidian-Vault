###### 1 
The Lord reigneth: let the earth rejoice: let the multitude of the Isles be glad. 

###### 2 
Clouds and darkness _are_ round about him: righteousness and judgment _are_ the foundation of his throne. 

###### 3 
There shall go a fire before him, and burn up his enemies round about. 

###### 4 
His lightnings gave light unto the world: the earth saw it and was afraid. 

###### 5 
The mountains melted like wax at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth. 

###### 6 
The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory. 

###### 7 
Confounded be all they that serve graven images, _and_ that glory in idols: worship him all ye gods. 

###### 8 
Zion heard of it, and was glad: and the daughters of Judah rejoiced, because of thy judgments, O Lord. 

###### 9 
For thou, Lord, art most High above all the earth: thou art much exalted above all gods. 

###### 10 
Ye that love the Lord, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his Saints: he will deliver them from the hand of the wicked. 

###### 11 
Light is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. 

###### 12 
Rejoice ye righteous in the Lord, and give thanks for his holy remembrance.
