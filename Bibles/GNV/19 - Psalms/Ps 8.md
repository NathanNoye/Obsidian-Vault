###### 1 
O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the world! which hast set thy glory above the heavens. 

###### 2 
Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength, because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger. 

###### 3 
When I behold thine heavens, _even_ the works of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained, 

###### 4 
What is man, _say I,_ that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man that thou visitest him? 

###### 5 
For thou hast made him a little lower than God, and crowned him with glory and worship. 

###### 6 
Thou hast made him to have dominion in the works of thine hands, thou hast put all things under his feet: 

###### 7 
All sheep and oxen: yea, and the beasts of the field: 

###### 8 
The fowls of the air, and the fish of the sea, _and_ that which passeth through the paths of the seas. 

###### 9 
O Lord our Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the world!
