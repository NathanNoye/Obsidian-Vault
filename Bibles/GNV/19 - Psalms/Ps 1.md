###### 1 
Blessed _is_ the man that doth not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the way of sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful. 

###### 2 
But his delight _is_ in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. 

###### 3 
For he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of waters, that will bring forth her fruits in due season: whose leaf shall not fade: so whatsoever he shall do, shall prosper. 

###### 4 
The wicked _are_ not so, but as the chaff, which the wind driveth away. 

###### 5 
Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous. 

###### 6 
For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, and the way of the wicked shall perish.
