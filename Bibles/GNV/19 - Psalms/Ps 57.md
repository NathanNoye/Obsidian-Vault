###### 1 
Have mercy upon me, O God, have mercy upon me; for my soul trusteth in thee, and in the shadow of thy wings will I trust, till _these_ afflictions overpass. 

###### 2 
I will call unto the most high God, _even_ the God, that performeth _his promise_ toward me. 

###### 3 
He will send from heaven, and save me from the reproof of him that would swallow me. Selah. God will send his mercy, and his truth. 

###### 4 
My soul _is_ among lions; I lie _among_ the children of men, that are set on fire; whose teeth _are_ spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword. 

###### 5 
Exalt thyself, O God, above the heaven, _and_ let thy glory _be_ upon all the earth. 

###### 6 
They have laid a net for my steps; my soul is pressed down, they have dug a pit before me, _and_ are fallen into the midst of it. Selah. 

###### 7 
Mine heart is prepared, O God, mine heart is prepared; I will sing and give praise. 

###### 8 
Awake my tongue, awake viol and harp: I will awake early. 

###### 9 
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, _and_ I will sing unto thee among the nations. 

###### 10 
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, _and_ thy truth unto the clouds. 

###### 11 
Exalt thyself, O God, above the heavens, _and_ let thy glory _be_ upon all the earth.
