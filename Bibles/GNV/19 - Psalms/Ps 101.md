***


###### 1 
I will sing mercy and judgment: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing. 

###### 2 
I will do wisely in the perfect way, till thou comest to me, I will walk in the uprightness of mine heart in the midst of my house. 

###### 3 
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that fall away: it shall not cleave unto me. 

###### 4 
A froward heart shall depart from me; I will know none evil. 

###### 5 
Him that privily slandereth his neighbor, will I destroy: him that hath a proud look and high heart, I cannot _suffer_. 

###### 6 
Mine eyes _shall be_ unto the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me. 

###### 7 
There shall no deceitful person dwell within my house: he that telleth lies, shall not remain in my sight. 

###### 8 
Betimes will I destroy all the wicked of the land that I may cut off all the workers of iniquity from the City of the Lord.
