***


###### 1 
I will praise thee with my whole heart: _even_ before the gods will I praise thee. 

###### 2 
I will worship toward thine holy Temple and praise thy Name, because of thy loving-kindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy Name above all things by thy word. 

###### 3 
When I called, then thou heardest me, _and_ hast increased strength in my soul. 

###### 4 
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord: for they have heard the words of thy mouth. 

###### 5 
And they shall sing of the ways of the Lord, because the glory of the Lord _is_ great. 

###### 6 
For the Lord is high, yet he beholdeth the lowly, but the proud he knoweth afar off. 

###### 7 
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, _yet_ wilt thou revive me: thou wilt stretch forth thine hand upon the wrath of mine enemies, and thy right hand shall save me. 

###### 8 
The Lord will perform _his work_ toward me: O Lord, thy mercy _endureth_ forever: forsake not the works of thine hands.
