###### 1 
Why do the heathen rage, and the people murmur in vain. 

###### 2 
The kings of the earth band themselves, and the Princes are assembled together against the Lord, and against his Christ. 

###### 3 
Let us break their bands, and cast their cords from us. 

###### 4 
_But_ he that dwelleth in the heaven shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision. 

###### 5 
Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure, _saying_, 

###### 6 
_Even_ I have set my King upon Zion mine holy mountain. 

###### 7 
I will declare the decree: _that is_, the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my son; this day have I begotten thee. 

###### 8 
Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the ends of the earth for thy possession. 

###### 9 
Thou shalt crush them with a scepter of iron, _and_ break them in pieces like a potter's vessel. 

###### 10 
Be wise now therefore, ye kings: be learned ye judges of the earth. 

###### 11 
Serve the Lord in fear, and rejoice in trembling. 

###### 12 
Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, when his wrath shall suddenly burn. Blessed _are_ all that trust in him.
