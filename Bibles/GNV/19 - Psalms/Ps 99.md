###### 1 
The Lord reigneth, let the people tremble: he sitteth _between_ the Cherubims, let the earth be moved. 

###### 2 
The Lord _is_ great in Zion, and he is high above all the people. 

###### 3 
They shall praise thy great and fearful Name (_for_ it is holy.) 

###### 4 
And the King's power, that loveth judgment: _for_ thou hast prepared equity: thou hast executed judgment and justice in Jacob. 

###### 5 
Exalt the Lord our God, and fall down before his footstool: _for_ he is holy. 

###### 6 
Moses and Aaron _were_ among his Priests, and Samuel among such as call upon his Name: these called upon the Lord, and he heard them. 

###### 7 
He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his testimonies, _and_ the Law _that_ he gave them. 

###### 8 
Thou heardest them, O Lord our God: thou wast a favorable God unto them, though thou didst take vengeance for their inventions. 

###### 9 
Exalt the Lord our God and fall down before his holy Mountain: for the Lord our God is holy.
