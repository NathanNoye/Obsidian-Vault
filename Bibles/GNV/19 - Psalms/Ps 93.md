***


###### 1 
The Lord reigneth, _and_ is clothed with majesty: the Lord is clothed, _and_ girded with power, the world also shall be established, that it cannot be moved. 

###### 2 
Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting. 

###### 3 
The floods have lifted up, O Lord: the floods have lifted up their voice: the floods lift up their waves. 

###### 4 
The waves of the sea _are_ marvelous through the noise of many waters, _yet_ the Lord on high is more mighty. 

###### 5 
Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine House, O Lord, forever.
