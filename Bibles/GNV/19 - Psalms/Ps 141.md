###### 1 
O Lord, I call upon thee: haste thee unto me: hear my voice, when I cry unto thee. 

###### 2 
Let my prayer be directed in thy sight _as_ incense, _and_ the lifting up of mine hands _as_ an evening sacrifice. 

###### 3 
Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, _and_ keep the door of my lips. 

###### 4 
Incline not mine heart to evil, that I should commit wicked works with them that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their delicates. 

###### 5 
Let the righteous smite me: _for that is_ a benefit: and let him reprove me, _and it shall be_ a precious oil that shall not break mine head: for within a while I shall even pray in their miseries. 

###### 6 
When their judges shall be cast down in stony places, they shall hear my words, for they are sweet. 

###### 7 
Our bones lie scattered at the grave's mouth, as he that heweth _wood_ or diggeth in the earth. 

###### 8 
But mine eyes _look_ unto thee, O Lord God: in thee is my trust: leave not my soul destitute. 

###### 9 
Keep me from the snare, _which_ they have laid for me, and from the gins of the workers of iniquity. 

###### 10 
Let the wicked fall into his nets together, while I escape.
