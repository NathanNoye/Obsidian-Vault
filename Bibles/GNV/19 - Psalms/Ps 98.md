###### 1 
Sing unto the Lord a new song: for he hath done marvelous things: his right hand, and his holy arm have gotten him the victory. 

###### 2 
The Lord declared his salvation: his righteousness hath he revealed in the sight of the nations. 

###### 3 
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. 

###### 4 
All the earth, sing ye loud unto the Lord: cry out and rejoice, and sing praises. 

###### 5 
Sing praise to the Lord upon the harp, _even_ upon the harp with a singing voice. 

###### 6 
With shalms and sound of trumpets sing loud before the Lord the king. 

###### 7 
Let the sea roar, and all that therein is, the world, and they that dwell therein. 

###### 8 
Let the floods clap their hands, _and_ let the mountains rejoice together, 

###### 9 
Before the Lord: for he is come to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world: and the people with equity.
