***


###### 1 
Lord, mine heart is not haughty, neither are mine eyes lofty, neither have I walked in great matters and hid from me. 

###### 2 
Surely I have behaved myself, like one weaned from his mother, and kept silence: I am in myself as one that is weaned. 

###### 3 
Let Israel wait on the Lord from henceforth and forever.
