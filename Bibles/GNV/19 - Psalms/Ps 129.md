***


###### 1 
They have oftentimes afflicted me from my youth (may Israel now say) 

###### 2 
They have oftentimes afflicted me from my youth: but they could not prevail against me. 

###### 3 
The plowers plowed upon my back, _and_ made long furrows. 

###### 4 
_But_ the righteous Lord hath cut the cords of the wicked. 

###### 5 
They that hate Zion, shall be all ashamed and turned backward. 

###### 6 
They _shall be_ as the grass on the house tops, which withereth afore it cometh forth. 

###### 7 
Whereof the mower filleth not his hand, neither the gleaner his lap: 

###### 8 
Neither they which go by, say, The blessing of the Lord _be_ upon you, _or_, We bless you in the Name of the Lord.
