***


###### 1 
I cried unto the Lord with my voice: with my voice I prayed unto the Lord. 

###### 2 
I poured out my meditation before him, _and_ declared mine affection in his presence. 

###### 3 
Though my spirit was in perplexity in me, yet thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked, have they privily laid a snare for me. 

###### 4 
I looked upon my right hand, and beheld, but there was none that would know me: all refuge failed me, _and_ none cared for my soul. 

###### 5 
_Then_ cried I unto thee, O Lord, _and_ said, Thou art mine hope, _and_ my portion in the land of the living. 

###### 6 
Hearken unto my cry, for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 

###### 7 
Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy Name: _then_ shall the righteous come about me, when thou art beneficial unto me.
