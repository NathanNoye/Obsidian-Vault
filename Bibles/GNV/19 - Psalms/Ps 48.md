###### 1 
Great _is_ the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the City of our God, _even_ upon his holy Mountain. 

###### 2 
Mount Zion, _lying_ Northward, _is_ fair in situation: _it is_ the joy of the whole earth, _and_ the City of the great king. 

###### 3 
In the palaces thereof God is known for a refuge. 

###### 4 
For lo, the kings were gathered, _and_ went together. 

###### 5 
When they saw it, they marveled: they were astonied, _and_ suddenly driven back. 

###### 6 
Fear came there upon them, _and_ sorrow, as upon a woman in travail. 

###### 7 
_As_ with an East wind thou breakest the ships of Tarshish, _so were they destroyed_. 

###### 8 
As we have heard, so have we seen in the City of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it forever. Selah. 

###### 9 
We wait for thy loving-kindness, O God, in the midst of thy Temple. 

###### 10 
O God, according to thy Name, so is thy praise unto the world's end: thy right hand is full of righteousness. 

###### 11 
Let mount Zion rejoice, _and_ the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments. 

###### 12 
Compass about Zion, and go round about it, _and_ tell the towers thereof. 

###### 13 
Mark well the wall thereof: behold her towers, that ye may tell your posterity. 

###### 14 
For this God _is_ our God forever and ever, he shall be our guide unto the death.
