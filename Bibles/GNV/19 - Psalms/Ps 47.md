###### 1 
All people clap your hands; sing loud unto God with a joyful voice. 

###### 2 
For the Lord _is_ high, _and_ terrible; a great King over all the earth. 

###### 3 
He hath subdued the people under us, and the nations under our feet. 

###### 4 
He hath chosen our inheritance for us: _even_ the glory of Jacob whom he loved. Selah. 

###### 5 
God is gone up with triumph, _even_ the Lord with the sound of the trumpet. 

###### 6 
Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King, sing praises. 

###### 7 
For God _is_ the king of all the earth: sing praises _everyone_ that hath understanding. 

###### 8 
God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon his holy Throne. 

###### 9 
The princes of the people are gathered unto the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the world _belong_ to God: he is greatly to be exalted.
