***


###### 1 
Sing ye unto the Lord a new song: let his praise _be heard_ in the Congregation of Saints. 

###### 2 
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him, and let the children of Zion rejoice in their King. 

###### 3 
Let them praise his Name with the flute: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp. 

###### 4 
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: he will make the meek glorious by deliverance. 

###### 5 
Let the Saints be joyful with glory: let them sing loud upon their beds. 

###### 6 
Let the high Acts of God be in their mouth, and a two edged sword in their hands, 

###### 7 
To execute vengeance upon the heathen, _and_ corrections among the people: 

###### 8 
To bind their kings in chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron, 

###### 9 
That they may execute upon them the judgment that is written: this honor shall be to all his Saints. Praise ye the Lord.
