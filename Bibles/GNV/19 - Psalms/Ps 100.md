***


###### 1 
Sing ye loud unto the Lord, all the earth. 

###### 2 
Serve the Lord with gladness; come before him with joyfulness. 

###### 3 
Know ye that even the Lord is God; he hath made us, and not we ourselves: _we are_ his people, and the sheep of his pasture. 

###### 4 
Enter into his gates with praise, _and_ into his courts with rejoicing: praise him _and_ bless his Name. 

###### 5 
For the Lord is good: his mercy is everlasting, and his truth _is_ from generation to generation.
