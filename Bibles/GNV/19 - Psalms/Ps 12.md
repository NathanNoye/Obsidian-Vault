###### 1 
Help Lord, for there is not a godly man left: for the faithful are failed from among the children of men. 

###### 2 
They speak deceitfully every one with his neighbor, flattering with their lips, _and_ speak with a double heart. 

###### 3 
The Lord cut off all flattering lips, _and_ the tongue that speaketh proud things: 

###### 4 
Which have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own; who is Lord over us? 

###### 5 
Now for the oppression of the needy, _and_ for the sighs of the poor, I will up, saith the Lord, _and_ will set at liberty him, _whom the wicked_ hath [snared]. 

###### 6 
The words of the Lord _are_ pure words, _as_ the silver, tried in a furnace of earth, fined sevenfold. 

###### 7 
Thou wilt keep them, O Lord; thou wilt preserve him from this generation forever. 

###### 8 
The wicked walk on every side; when they are exalted, _it is_ a shame for the sons of men.
