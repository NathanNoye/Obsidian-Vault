###### 1 
O Lord my God, in thee I put my trust: save me from all that persecute me, and deliver me, 

###### 2 
Lest he devour my soul like a lion, and tear it in pieces, while there is none to help. 

###### 3 
O Lord my God, if I have done this thing, if there be _any_ wickedness in mine hands, 

###### 4 
If I have rewarded evil unto him that had peace with me, (yea I have delivered him that vexed me without cause.) 

###### 5 
_Then_ let the enemies persecute my soul, and take it: yea, let him tread my life down upon the earth, and lay mine honor in the dust. Selah. 

###### 6 
Arise, O Lord, in thy wrath, and lift up thyself against the rage of mine enemies, and awake for me _according_ to the judgment _that_ thou hast appointed. 

###### 7 
So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return on high. 

###### 8 
The Lord shall judge the people: judge thou me, O Lord, according to my righteousness, and according to mine innocency _that is_ in me. 

###### 9 
Oh let the malice of the wicked come to an end: but guide thou the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins. 

###### 10 
My defense _is_ in God, who preserveth the upright in heart. 

###### 11 
God judgeth the righteous, and him that contemneth God, every day. 

###### 12 
Except he turn, he hath whet his sword: he hath bent his bow, and made it ready. 

###### 13 
He hath also prepared him deadly weapons: he will ordain his arrows for them that persecute _me_. 

###### 14 
Behold, he shall travail with wickedness: for he hath conceived mischief, but he shall bring forth a lie. 

###### 15 
He hath made a pit, and dug it, and is fallen into the pit _that_ he made. 

###### 16 
His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his cruelty shall fall upon his own pate. 

###### 17 
I will praise the Lord according to his righteousness, and will sing praise to the Name of the Lord most high.
