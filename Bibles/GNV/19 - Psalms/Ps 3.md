***


###### 1 
Lord, how are mine adversaries increased? how many rise against me? 

###### 2 
Many say to my soul, _There is_ no help for him in God. Selah. 

###### 3 
But thou Lord art a buckler for me, my glory, and the lifter up of mine head. 

###### 4 
I did call unto the Lord with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy mountain. Selah. 

###### 5 
I laid me down and slept, _and_ rose up again: for the Lord sustained me. 

###### 6 
I will not be afraid for ten thousand of the people, that should beset me round about. 

###### 7 
O Lord, arise: help me, my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheekbone: thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked. 

###### 8 
Salvation _belongeth_ unto the Lord, _and_ thy blessing _is_ upon thy people. Selah.
