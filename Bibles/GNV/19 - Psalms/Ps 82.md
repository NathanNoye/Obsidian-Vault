###### 1 
God standeth in the assembly of gods: he judgeth among gods. 

###### 2 
How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah. 

###### 3 
Do right to the poor and fatherless: do justice to the poor and needy. 

###### 4 
Deliver the poor and needy: save _them_ from the hand of the wicked. 

###### 5 
They know not and understand nothing: they walk in darkness, _albeit_ all the foundations of the earth be moved. 

###### 6 
I have said, Ye are gods, and ye all are children of the most High. 

###### 7 
But ye shall die as a man, and ye princes shall fall like others. 

###### 8 
O God, arise, _therefore_ judge thou the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.
