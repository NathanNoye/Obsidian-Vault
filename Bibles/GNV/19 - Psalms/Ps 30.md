###### 1 
I will magnify thee, O Lord: thou hast exalted me, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me. 

###### 2 
O Lord my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast restored me. 

###### 3 
O Lord, thou hast brought up my soul out of the grave: thou hast revived me from them that go down into the pit. 

###### 4 
Sing praises unto the Lord, ye his Saints, and give thanks before the remembrance of his Holiness. 

###### 5 
For _he endureth but_ a while in his anger: _but_ in his favor _is_ life: weeping may abide at evening, but joy _cometh_ in the morning. 

###### 6 
And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved. 

###### 7 
_For_ thou Lord of thy goodness hadst made my mountain to stand strong: _but_ thou didst hide thy face, _and_ I was troubled. 

###### 8 
_Then_ cried I unto thee, O Lord, and prayed to my Lord. 

###### 9 
What profit _is there_ in my blood, when I go down to the pit! shall the dust give thanks unto thee? or shall it declare thy truth? 

###### 10 
Hear, O Lord, and have mercy upon me: Lord, be thou mine helper. 

###### 11 
Thou hast turned my mourning into joy: thou hast loosed my sack, and girded me with gladness. 

###### 12 
Therefore shall _my_ tongue praise thee and not cease: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee forever.
