###### 1 
O God, mine heart _is_ prepared, so _is_ my tongue: I will sing and give praise. 

###### 2 
Awake viol and harp, I will awake early. 

###### 3 
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people, and I will sing unto thee among the nations. 

###### 4 
For thy mercy is great above the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds. 

###### 5 
Exalt thyself, O God, above the heavens, and _let_ thy glory _be_ upon all the earth, 

###### 6 
That thy beloved may be delivered: help with thy right hand and hear me. 

###### 7 
God hath spoken in his holiness: _therefore_ I will rejoice, I shall divide Shechem and measure the valley of Succoth. 

###### 8 
Gilead _shall be_ mine, _and_ Manasseh _shall be_ mine: Ephraim also _shall be_ the strength of mine head: Judah _is_ my lawgiver. 

###### 9 
Moab _shall be_ my washpot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe: upon Palestine will I triumph. 

###### 10 
Who will lead me into the strong city? who will bring me unto Edom? 

###### 11 
Wilt not thou, O God, _which_ hadst forsaken us, and didst not go forth, O God, with our armies? 

###### 12 
Give us help against trouble: for vain is the help of man. 

###### 13 
Through God we shall do valiantly: for he shall tread down our enemies.
