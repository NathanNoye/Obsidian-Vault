###### 1 
Be merciful unto me, O God, for man would swallow me up: he fighteth continually _and_ vexeth me. 

###### 2 
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for many fight against me, O thou most High. 

###### 3 
When I was afraid, I trusted in thee. 

###### 4 
I will rejoice in God, _because_ of his word, I trust in God, _and_ will not fear what flesh can do unto me. 

###### 5 
Mine own words grieve _me_ daily: all their thoughts _are_ against me to do me hurt. 

###### 6 
They gather together, and keep themselves close: they mark my steps, because they wait for my soul. 

###### 7 
They _think_ they shall escape by iniquity: O God, cast _these_ people down in _thine_ anger. 

###### 8 
Thou hast counted my wanderings; put my tears into thy bottle; are they not in thy register? 

###### 9 
When I cry, then mine enemies shall turn back; this I know, for God is with me. 

###### 10 
I will rejoice in God _because of his_ word; in the Lord will I rejoice _because of his_ word. 

###### 11 
In God do I trust; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me. 

###### 12 
Thy vows _are_ upon me, O God, I will render praises unto thee. 

###### 13 
For thou hast delivered my soul from death, and also my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living.
