###### 1 
O Lord of hosts, how amiable _are_ thy Tabernacles? 

###### 2 
My soul longeth, yea, and fainted for the courts of the Lord: _for_ my heart and my flesh rejoice in the living God. 

###### 3 
Yea, the sparrow hath found _her_ an house, and the swallow a nest for her, where she may lay her young: _even_ by thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my king _and_ my God. 

###### 4 
Blessed _are_ they that dwell in thine house, they will ever praise thee. Selah. 

###### 5 
Blessed _is_ the man whose strength _is_ in thee, _and_ in whose heart _are thy_ ways. 

###### 6 
They going through the valley of Baca, make wells therein: the rain also covereth the pools. 

###### 7 
They go from strength to strength, _till every one_ appear before God in Zion. 

###### 8 
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer, hearken, O God of Jacob. Selah. 

###### 9 
Behold, O God, our shield, and look upon the face of thine Anointed. 

###### 10 
For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand _other where_: I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tabernacles of wickedness. 

###### 11 
For the Lord God is the sun and shield _unto us_: the Lord will give grace and glory, and no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly. 

###### 12 
O Lord of hosts, blessed _is_ the man that trusteth in thee.
