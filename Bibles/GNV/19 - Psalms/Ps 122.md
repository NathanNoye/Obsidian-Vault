***


###### 1 
I rejoiced when they said to me, We will go into the house of the Lord. 

###### 2 
Our feet shall stand in thy gates, O Jerusalem. 

###### 3 
Jerusalem _is_ built as a city, that is compact together in itself: 

###### 4 
Whereunto the Tribes, _even_ the Tribes of the Lord go up _according_ to the testimony to Israel, to praise the Name of the Lord. 

###### 5 
For there are thrones set for judgment, _even_ the thrones of the house of David. 

###### 6 
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: let them prosper that love thee. 

###### 7 
Peace be within thy walls, _and_ prosperity within thy palaces. 

###### 8 
For my brethren and neighbors' sakes, I will wish thee now prosperity. 

###### 9 
Because of the House of the Lord our God, I will procure thy wealth.
