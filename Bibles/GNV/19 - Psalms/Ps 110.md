###### 1 
The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. 

###### 2 
The Lord shall send the rod of thy power out of Zion: be thou ruler in the midst of thine enemies. 

###### 3 
Thy people _shall come_ willingly at the time _of assembling_ thine army in holy beauty: the youth of thy womb _shall be_ as the morning dew. 

###### 4 
The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek. 

###### 5 
The Lord _that is_ at thy right hand, shall wound kings in the day of his wrath. 

###### 6 
He shall be judge among the heathen: he shall fill _all_ with dead bodies, _and_ smite the head over great countries. 

###### 7 
He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up _his_ head.
