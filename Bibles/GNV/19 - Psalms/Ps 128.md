###### 1 
Blessed _is_ everyone that feareth the Lord, and walketh in his ways. 

###### 2 
When thou eatest the labors of thine hands, thou shalt be blessed, and it shall be well with thee. 

###### 3 
Thy wife _shall be_ as the fruitful vine on the sides of thine house, _and_ thy children like the olive plants round about thy table. 

###### 4 
Lo, surely thus shall the man be blessed, that feareth the Lord. 

###### 5 
The Lord out of Zion shall bless thee, and thou shalt see the wealth of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. 

###### 6 
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, _and_ peace upon Israel.
