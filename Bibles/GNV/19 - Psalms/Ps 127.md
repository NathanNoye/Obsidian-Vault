***


###### 1 
Except the Lord build the house, they labor in vain that build it: except the Lord keep the city, the keeper watcheth in vain. 

###### 2 
It is in vain for you to rise early, _and_ to lie down late, _and_ eat the bread of sorrow: but he will surely give rest to his beloved. 

###### 3 
Behold, children are the inheritance of the Lord, _and_ the fruit of the womb _his_ reward. 

###### 4 
As _are_ the arrows in the hand of the strong man; so _are_ the children of youth. 

###### 5 
Blessed _is_ the man that hath his quiver full of them: _for_ they shall not be ashamed, when they speak with _their_ enemies in the gate.
