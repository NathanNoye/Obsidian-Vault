###### 1 
Give unto the Lord, ye sons of the mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength. 

###### 2 
Give unto the Lord glory _due_ unto his Name: worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuary. 

###### 3 
The voice of the Lord _is_ upon the waters: the God of glory maketh it to thunder: the Lord _is_ upon the great waters. 

###### 4 
The voice of the Lord _is_ mighty: the voice of the Lord _is_ glorious. 

###### 5 
The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars: yea, the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon. 

###### 6 
He maketh them also to leap like a calf: Lebanon _also_ and Shirion like a young unicorn. 

###### 7 
The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire. 

###### 8 
The voice of the Lord maketh the wilderness to tremble: the Lord maketh the wilderness of Kadesh to tremble. 

###### 9 
The voice of the Lord maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: _therefore_ in his Temple doth every man speak of _his_ glory. 

###### 10 
The Lord sitteth upon the floods, and the Lord doth remain King forever. 

###### 11 
The Lord shall give strength unto his people: the Lord shall bless his people with peace.
