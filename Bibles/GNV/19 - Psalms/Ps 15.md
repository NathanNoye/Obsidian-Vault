###### 1 
Lord, who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in thine holy Mountain? 

###### 2 
He that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness, and speaketh the truth in his heart. 

###### 3 
He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his neighbor, nor receiveth a false report against his neighbor. 

###### 4 
In whose eyes a vile person is contemned, but he _honoreth_ them that fear the Lord: he that sweareth to his _own_ hindrance and changeth not. 

###### 5 
He that giveth not his money unto usury, nor taketh reward against the innocent: he that doeth these things, shall never be moved.
