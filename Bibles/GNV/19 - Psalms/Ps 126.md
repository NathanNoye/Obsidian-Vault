***


###### 1 
When the Lord brought again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream. 

###### 2 
Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with joy: then said they among the heathen, The Lord hath done great things for them. 

###### 3 
The Lord hath done great things for us, _whereof _we rejoice. 

###### 4 
O Lord, bring again our captivity, as the rivers in the South. 

###### 5 
They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy. 

###### 6 
They went weeping, and carried precious seed: _but_ they shall return with joy, and bring their sheaves.
