###### 1 
_God laid_ his foundations among the holy mountains. 

###### 2 
The Lord loveth the gates of Zion above all the habitations of Jacob. 

###### 3 
Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah. 

###### 4 
I will make mention of Rahab and Babel among them that know me: behold Palestine and Tyre with Ethiopia, There is he born. 

###### 5 
And of Zion it shall be said, Many are born in her: and he, _even_ the most High shall stablish her. 

###### 6 
The Lord shall count, when he writeth the people, He was born there. Selah. 

###### 7 
As well the singers as the players on instruments _shall praise thee_: all my springs _are_ in thee.
