###### 1 
O God, _haste thee_ to deliver me: make haste to help me, O Lord. 

###### 2 
Let them be confounded and put to shame, that seek my soul: let them be turned backward and put to rebuke, that desire mine hurt. 

###### 3 
Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame, which say, Aha, aha. 

###### 4 
_But_ let all those that seek thee, be joyful and glad in thee, and let all that love thy salvation, say always, God be praised. 

###### 5 
Now I am poor and needy: O God, make haste to me: thou art my helper, and my deliverer: O Lord, make no tarrying.
