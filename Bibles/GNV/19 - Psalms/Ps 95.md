###### 1 
Come, let us rejoice unto the Lord: let us sing aloud unto the rock of our salvation. 

###### 2 
Let us come before his face with praise: let us sing loud unto him with Psalms. 

###### 3 
For the Lord _is_ a great God, and a great King above all gods, 

###### 4 
In whose hand _are_ the deep places of the earth, and the heights of the mountains _are_ his, 

###### 5 
To whom the Sea _belongeth_, for he made it, and his hands formed the dry land. 

###### 6 
Come, let us worship and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our maker. 

###### 7 
For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand: today, if ye will hear his voice, 

###### 8 
Harden not your heart, as in Meribah, _and_ as in the day of Massah in the wilderness, 

###### 9 
When your fathers tempted me, proved me, though they had seen my work. 

###### 10 
Forty years have I contended with _this_ generation, and said, They are a people that err in heart, for they have not known my ways. 

###### 11 
Wherefore I sware in my wrath, _saying_, Surely they shall not enter into my rest.
