***


###### 1 
Out of the deep places have I called unto thee, O Lord. 

###### 2 
Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears attend to the voice of my prayers. 

###### 3 
If thou, O Lord, straightly markest iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand? 

###### 4 
But mercy _is_ with thee, that thou mayest be feared. 

###### 5 
I have waited on the Lord: my soul hath waited, and I have trusted in his word. 

###### 6 
My soul _waiteth_ on the Lord more than the morning watch watcheth for the morning. 

###### 7 
Let Israel wait on the Lord: for with the Lord _is_ mercy, and with him _is_ great redemption. 

###### 8 
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
