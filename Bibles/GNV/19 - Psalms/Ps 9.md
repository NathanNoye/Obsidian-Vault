###### 1 
I will praise the Lord with my whole heart: I will speak of all thy marvelous works. 

###### 2 
I will be glad, and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy Name, O most High. 

###### 3 
For that mine enemies are turned back: they shall fall and perish at thy presence. 

###### 4 
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause: thou art set in the throne, _and_ judgest right. 

###### 5 
Thou hast rebuked the heathen: thou hast destroyed the wicked: thou hast put out their name forever and ever. 

###### 6 
O enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end, and thou hast destroyed the cities: their memorial is perished with them. 

###### 7 
But the Lord shall sit forever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment. 

###### 8 
For he shall judge the world in righteousness, _and_ shall judge the people with equity. 

###### 9 
The Lord also will be a refuge for the poor, a refuge in _due_ time, _even_ in affliction. 

###### 10 
And they that know thy Name, will trust in thee: for thou, Lord, hast not failed them that seek thee. 

###### 11 
Sing praises to the Lord, which dwelleth in Zion: show the people his works. 

###### 12 
For when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth it, _and_ forgetteth not the complaint of the poor. 

###### 13 
Have mercy upon me, O Lord: consider my trouble _which I suffer_ of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death, 

###### 14 
That I may show all thy praises within the gates of the daughter of Zion, _and_ rejoice in thy salvation. 

###### 15 
The heathen are sunken down in the pit _that_ they made: in the net that they hid, is their foot taken. 

###### 16 
The Lord is known by executing judgment: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands, Higgaion. Selah. 

###### 17 
The wicked shall turn into hell, _and_ all nations that forget God. 

###### 18 
For the poor shall not be always forgotten: the hope of the afflicted shall not perish forever. 

###### 19 
Up Lord: let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight. 

###### 20 
Put them in fear, O Lord, that the heathen may know that they are but men. Selah.
