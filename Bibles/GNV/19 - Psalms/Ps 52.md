###### 1 
Why boastest thou thyself in _thy_ wickedness, O man of power? the loving-kindness of God _endureth_ daily. 

###### 2 
Thy tongue imagineth mischief, _and is_ like a sharp razor, that cutteth deceitfully. 

###### 3 
Thou dost love evil more than good, _and_ lies more than to speak the truth. Selah. 

###### 4 
Thou lovest all words that may destroy: O deceitful tongue! 

###### 5 
So shall God destroy thee forever: he shall take thee and pluck thee out of _thy_ tabernacle, and root thee out of the land of the living. Selah. 

###### 6 
The righteous also shall see it, _and_ fear, and shall laugh at him, _saying_, 

###### 7 
Behold the man that took not God for his strength, but trusteth unto the multitude of his riches, _and_ put his strength in his malice. 

###### 8 
But I shall be like a green olive tree in the house of God: _for_ I trusted in the mercy of God forever and ever. 

###### 9 
I will always praise thee, for that thou hast done _this_, and I will hope in thy name, because it is good before thy Saints.
