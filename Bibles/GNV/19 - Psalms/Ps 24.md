###### 1 
The earth _is_ the Lord's, and all that therein is; the world and they that dwell therein. 

###### 2 
For he hath founded it upon the seas; and established it upon the floods. 

###### 3 
Who shall ascend into the mountain of the Lord? and who shall stand in his holy place? 

###### 4 
_Even he that hath_ innocent hands, and a pure heart; which hath not lifted up his mind unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully. 

###### 5 
He shall receive a blessing from the Lord, and righteousness from the God of his salvation. 

###### 6 
This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek thy face, _this is_ Jacob. Selah. 

###### 7 
Lift up your heads ye gates, and be ye lifted up ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. 

###### 8 
Who is this King of glory? the Lord, strong and mighty, _even_ the Lord mighty in battle. 

###### 9 
Lift up your heads, ye gates, and lift up _yourselves_ ye everlasting doors, and the King of glory shall come in. 

###### 10 
Who is this King of glory? the Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
