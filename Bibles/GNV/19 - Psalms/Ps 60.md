###### 1 
O God, thou hast cast us out, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been angry, turn again unto us. 

###### 2 
Thou hast made the land to tremble, and hast made it to gape: heal the breaches thereof, for it is shaken. 

###### 3 
Thou hast showed thy people heavy things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of giddiness. 

###### 4 
_But now_ thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of _thy_ truth. Selah. 

###### 5 
That thy beloved may be delivered, help with thy right hand and hear me. 

###### 6 
God hath spoken in his holiness: _therefore_ I will rejoice: I shall divide Shechem, and measure the valley of Succoth. 

###### 7 
Gilead _shall be_ mine, and Manasseh _shall be_ mine: Ephraim also _shall be_ the strength of mine head: Judah _is_ my lawgiver. 

###### 8 
Moab _shall be_ my washpot: over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia show thyself joyful for me. 

###### 9 
Who will lead me into the strong city? who will bring me unto Edom? 

###### 10 
Wilt not thou, O God, _which_ hadst cast us off, and didst not go forth, O God, with our armies? 

###### 11 
Give us help against trouble: for vain is the help of man. 

###### 12 
Through God we shall do valiantly; for he shall tread down our enemies.
