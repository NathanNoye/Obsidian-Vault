###### 1 
Praise, O ye servants of the Lord, praise the Name of the Lord. 

###### 2 
Blessed be the Name of the Lord from henceforth and forever. 

###### 3 
The Lord's Name is praised from the rising of the sun, unto the going down of the same. 

###### 4 
The Lord is high above all nations, _and_ his glory above the heavens. 

###### 5 
Who is like unto the Lord our God, that hath his dwelling on high. 

###### 6 
Who abaseth himself to behold _things_ in the heavens and in the earth! 

###### 7 
He raiseth the needy out of the dust, _and_ lifteth up the poor out of the dung, 

###### 8 
That he may set him with the princes, _even_ with the princes of his people. 

###### 9 
He maketh the barren woman to dwell with a family, _and_ a joyful mother of children. Praise ye the Lord.
