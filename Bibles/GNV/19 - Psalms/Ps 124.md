***


###### 1 
If the Lord had not been on our side, (may Israel now say) 

###### 2 
If the Lord had n been on our side, when men rose up against us, 

###### 3 
They had then swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us. 

###### 4 
Then the waters had drowned us, _and_ the stream had gone over our soul: 

###### 5 
Then had the swelling waters gone over our soul. 

###### 6 
Praised _be_ the Lord, which hath not given us_ as_ a prey unto their teeth. 

###### 7 
Our soul is escaped, even as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are delivered. 

###### 8 
Our help _is_ in the Name of the Lord, which hath made heaven and earth.
