###### 1 
Sing unto the Lord a new song: sing unto the Lord all the earth. 

###### 2 
Sing unto the Lord, _and_ praise his Name: declare his salvation from day to day. 

###### 3 
Declare his glory among all nations, _and_ his wonders among all people. 

###### 4 
For the Lord _is_ great and much to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods. 

###### 5 
For all the gods of the people _are_ idols: but the Lord made the heavens. 

###### 6 
Strength and glory _are_ before him: power and beauty _are_ in his Sanctuary. 

###### 7 
Give unto the Lord, ye families of the people: give unto the Lord glory and power. 

###### 8 
Give unto the Lord the glory of his Name: bring an offering, and enter into his courts. 

###### 9 
Worship the Lord in the glorious Sanctuary: tremble before him all the earth. 

###### 10 
Say among the Nations, The Lord reigneth: Surely the world shall be stable, _and_ not move, _and_ he shall judge the people in righteousness. 

###### 11 
Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad: let the sea roar, and all that therein is. 

###### 12 
Let the field be joyful, and all that is in it: let all the trees of the wood then rejoice, 

###### 13 
Before the Lord: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he will judge the world with righteousness, and the people in his truth.
