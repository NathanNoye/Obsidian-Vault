###### 1 
Lord, thou hast been favorable unto thy land: thou hast brought again the captivity of Jacob. 

###### 2 
Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, _and_ covered all their sins. Selah. 

###### 3 
Thou hast withdrawn all thine anger, and hast turned back from the fierceness of thy wrath. 

###### 4 
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and release thine anger toward us. 

###### 5 
Wilt thou be angry with us forever? _and_ wilt thou prolong thy wrath from one generation to another? 

###### 6 
Wilt thou not turn again _and_ quicken us, that thy people may rejoice in thee? 

###### 7 
Show us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. 

###### 8 
I will hearken what the Lord God will say: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his Saints, that they turn not again to folly. 

###### 9 
Surely his salvation is near to them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land. 

###### 10 
Mercy and truth shall meet, righteousness and peace shall kiss _one another_. 

###### 11 
Truth shall bud out of the earth, and righteousness shall look down from heaven. 

###### 12 
Yea, the Lord shall give good things, and our land shall give her increase. 

###### 13 
Righteousness shall go before him, and shall set her steps in the way.
