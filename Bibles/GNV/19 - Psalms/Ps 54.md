###### 1 
Save me, O God, by thy Name, and by thy power judge me. 

###### 2 
O God, hear my prayer: hearken unto the words of my mouth. 

###### 3 
For strangers are risen up against me, and tyrants seek my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah. 

###### 4 
Behold, God _is_ mine helper: the Lord _is_ with them that uphold my soul. 

###### 5 
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: Oh cut them off in thy truth! 

###### 6 
_Then_ I will sacrifice freely unto thee: I will praise thy Name, O Lord, because it is good. 

###### 7 
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble, and mine eye hath seen _my desire_ upon mine enemies.
