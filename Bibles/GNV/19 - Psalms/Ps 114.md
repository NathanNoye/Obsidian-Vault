***


###### 1 
When Israel went out of Egypt, _and_ the house of Jacob from the barbarous people, 

###### 2 
Judah was his sanctification, _and_ Israel his dominion. 

###### 3 
The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was turned back. 

###### 4 
The mountains leaped like rams, _and_ the hills as lambs! 

###### 5 
What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest? O Jordan, _why_ wast thou turned back? 

###### 6 
Ye mountains _why_ leaped ye like rams, _and ye_ hills as lambs? 

###### 7 
The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob, 

###### 8 
Which turneth the rock into waterpools, _and_ the flint into a fountain of water.
