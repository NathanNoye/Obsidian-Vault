***


###### 1 
I called unto the Lord in my trouble, and he heard me. 

###### 2 
Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, _and_ from a deceitful tongue. 

###### 3 
What doth _thy_ deceitful tongue bring unto thee? or what doth it avail thee? 

###### 4 
_It is as_ the sharp arrows of a mighty man, and _as_ the coals of Juniper. 

###### 5 
Woe is to me that I remain in Meshech, _and_ dwell in the tents of Kedar. 

###### 6 
My soul hath too long dwelt with him that hateth peace. 

###### 7 
I _seek_ peace, and when I speak _thereof_, they are _bent_ to war.
