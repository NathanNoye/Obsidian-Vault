###### 1 
God _is_ our hope and strength, _and_ help in troubles, ready to be found. 

###### 2 
Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be moved, and though the mountains fall into the midst of the sea, 

###### 3 
_Though_ the waters thereof rage _and_ be troubled, _and_ the mountains shake at the surges of the same. Selah. 

###### 4 
_Yet there is_ a River, whose stream shall make glad the City of God: _even_ the Sanctuary of the Tabernacles of the most High. 

###### 5 
God _is_ in the midst of it: _therefore_ shall it not be moved: God shall help it very early. 

###### 6 
_When_ the nations raged, _and_ the kingdoms were moved, _God_ thundered, _and_ the earth melted. 

###### 7 
The Lord of hosts _is_ with us; the God of Jacob _is_ our refuge. Selah. 

###### 8 
Come _and_ behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth. 

###### 9 
He maketh wars to cease unto the ends of the world, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear, _and_ burneth the chariots with fire. 

###### 10 
Be still and know that I am God, I will be exalted among the heathen, _and_ I will be exalted in the earth. 

###### 11 
The Lord of hosts _is_ with us; the God of Jacob _is_ our refuge. Selah.
