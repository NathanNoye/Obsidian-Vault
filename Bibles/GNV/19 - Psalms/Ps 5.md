###### 1 
Hear my words, O Lord: understand my meditation. 

###### 2 
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my king and my God: for unto thee do I pray. 

###### 3 
Hear my voice in the morning, O Lord: _for_ in the morning will I direct _me_ unto thee, and I will wait. 

###### 4 
For thou art not a God that loveth wickedness, neither shall evil dwell with thee. 

###### 5 
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: _for_ thou hatest all them that work iniquity. 

###### 6 
Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: the Lord will abhor the bloody man and deceitful. 

###### 7 
But I will come into thine house in the multitude of thy mercy: _and_ in thy fear will I worship toward thine holy Temple. 

###### 8 
Lead me, O Lord, in thy righteousness, because of _mine_ enemies: make thy way plain before my face. 

###### 9 
For no constancy _is_ in their mouth: within they are very corruption: their throat _is_ an open sepulcher, _and_ they flatter with their tongue. 

###### 10 
Destroy them, O God, let them fall from their counsels: cast them out for the multitude of their iniquities, because they have rebelled against thee. 

###### 11 
And let all them that trust in thee, rejoice _and_ triumph forever, and cover thou them: and let them that love thy name, rejoice in thee. 

###### 12 
For thou Lord, wilt bless the righteous, _and_ with favor wilt compass him, as with a shield.
