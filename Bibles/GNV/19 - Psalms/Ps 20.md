###### 1 
The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble: the Name of the God of Jacob defend thee: 

###### 2 
Send thee help from the Sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion. 

###### 3 
Let him remember all thine offerings, and turn thy burnt offerings into ashes. Selah. 

###### 4 
_And_ grant thee according to thine heart, and fulfill all thy purpose: 

###### 5 
_That_ we may rejoice in thy salvation, and set up the banner in the Name of our God, _when_ the Lord shall perform all thy petitions. 

###### 6 
Now know I that the Lord will help his anointed, _and_ will hear him from his Sanctuary, by the mighty help of his right hand. 

###### 7 
Some _trust_ in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the Name of the Lord our God. 

###### 8 
They are brought down and fallen, but we are risen, and stand upright. 

###### 9 
Save Lord: Let the King hear us in the day that we call.
