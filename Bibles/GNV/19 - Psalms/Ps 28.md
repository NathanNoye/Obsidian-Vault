###### 1 
Unto thee, O Lord, do I cry: O my strength, be not deaf toward me, lest if thou answer me not, I be like them that go down into the pit. 

###### 2 
Hear the voice of my petitions, when I cry unto thee, when I hold up my hands toward thine holy Oracle. 

###### 3 
Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity: which speak friendly to their neighbors, when malice _is_ in their hearts. 

###### 4 
Reward them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their inventions: recompense them after the work of their hands: render them their reward. 

###### 5 
For they reward not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands: _therefore_ break them down, and build them not up. 

###### 6 
Praised _be_ the Lord, for he hath heard the voice of my petitions. 

###### 7 
The Lord _is_ my strength and my shield: mine heart trusted in him, and I was helped: therefore mine heart shall rejoice, and with my song will I praise him. 

###### 8 
The Lord _is_ their strength, and he is the strength of the deliverances of his anointed. 

###### 9 
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and exalt them forever.
