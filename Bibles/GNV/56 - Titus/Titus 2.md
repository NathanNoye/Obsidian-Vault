###### 1 
But speak thou the things which become wholesome doctrine, 

###### 2 
That the elder men be watchful, grave, temperate, sound in the faith, in love, _and_ in patience: 

###### 3 
The elder women likewise, that they be in such behavior as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not subject to much wine, _but_ teachers of honest things. 

###### 4 
That they may instruct the young women to be sober minded, that they love their husbands, that they love their children, 

###### 5 
_That they be_ temperate, chaste, keeping at home, good and subject unto their husbands, that the word of God be not evil spoken of. 

###### 6 
Exhort young men likewise, that they be sober minded. 

###### 7 
In all things show thyself an example of good works with uncorrupt doctrine, with gravity, integrity, 

###### 8 
_And_ with the wholesome word, which cannot be condemned, that he which withstandeth, may be ashamed, having nothing concerning you to speak evil of. 

###### 9 
Let servants be subject to their masters, and please _them_ in all things, not answering again, 

###### 10 
Neither pickers, but that they show all good faithfulness, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things. 

###### 11 
For that grace of God, that bringeth salvation unto all men, hath appeared, 

###### 12 
And teacheth us, that we should deny ungodliness and worldly lusts, and that we should live soberly and righteously, and godly in this present world, 

###### 13 
Looking for that blessed hope, and appearing of that glory of that mighty God, and of our Savior Jesus Christ. 

###### 14 
Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purge us _to be_ a peculiar people unto himself, zealous of good works. 

###### 15 
These things speak, and exhort, and convince with all authority. See that no man despise thee.
