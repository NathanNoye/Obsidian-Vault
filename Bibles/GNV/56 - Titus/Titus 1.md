###### 1 
Paul a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth, which is according unto godliness. 

###### 2 
Unto the hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie, hath promised before the world began: 

###### 3 
But hath made his word manifest in due time through the preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Savior: 

###### 4 
To Titus _my_ natural son according to the common faith, Grace, mercy, _and_ peace from God the Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior. 

###### 5 
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest continue to redress the things that remain, and shouldest ordain Elders in every city as I ap-pointed thee. 

###### 6 
If any be unreproveable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children, which are not slandered of riot, neither are disobedient. 

###### 7 
For a Bishop must be unreproveable, as God's steward, not froward, not angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre, 

###### 8 
But harberous, one that loveth goodness, wise, righteous, holy, temperate, 

###### 9 
Holding fast that faithful word according to doctrine, that he also may be able to exhort with wholesome doctrine, and convince them that say against it. 

###### 10 
For there are many disobedient and vain talkers and deceivers of minds, chiefly they of the Circumcision, 

###### 11 
Whose mouths must be stopped, which subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake. 

###### 12 
One of themselves, _even_ one of their own Prophets said, The Cretans _are_ always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies. 

###### 13 
This witness is true: wherefore convince them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith. 

###### 14 
And not taking heed to Jewish fables and commandments of men, that turn away from the truth. 

###### 15 
Unto the pure _are_ all things pure, but unto them that are defiled, and unbelieving, _is_ nothing pure, but even their minds and consciences are defiled. 

###### 16 
They profess that they know God, but by works they deny _him_, and are abominable and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
