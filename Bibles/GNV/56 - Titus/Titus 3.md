###### 1 
Put them in remembrance that they be subject to the principalities and powers, _and_ that they be obedient, _and_ ready to every good work. 

###### 2 
That they speak evil of no man, that they be no fighters, _but_ soft, showing all meekness unto all men. 

###### 3 
For we ourselves also were in times past unwise, disobedient, deceived, serving the lusts and divers pleasures, living in maliciousness and envy, hateful, _and_ hating one another. 

###### 4 
But when that bountifulness and that love of God our Savior toward man appeared, 

###### 5 
Not by the works of righteousness, which we had done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of the new birth, and the renewing of the holy Ghost, 

###### 6 
Which he shed on us abundantly, through Jesus Christ our Savior, 

###### 7 
That we, being justified by his grace, should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. 

###### 8 
This is a true saying, and these things I will thou shouldest affirm, that they which have believed God, might be careful to show forth good works. These things are good and profitable unto men. 

###### 9 
But stay foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and brawlings about the Law: for they are unprofitable and vain. 

###### 10 
Reject him that is an heretic, after once or twice admonition, 

###### 11 
Knowing that he that is such, is perverted, and sinneth, being damned of his own self. 

###### 12 
When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me unto Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter. 

###### 13 
Bring Zenas the expounder of the Law, and Apollos on their journey diligently, that they lack nothing. 

###### 14 
And let ours also learn to show forth good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful. 

###### 15 
All that are with me, salute thee. Greet them that love us in the faith. Grace _be_ with you all. Amen. ¶ To Titus, elect the first Bishop of the Church of the Cretans, written from Nicopolis in Macedonia.
