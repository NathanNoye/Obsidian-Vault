###### 1 
Let us fear therefore, lest at any time by forsaking the promise of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to be deprived. 

###### 2 
For unto us was the Gospel preached as also unto them: but the word that they heard, profited not them, because it was not mixed with faith in those that heard it. 

###### 3 
For we which have believed, do enter into rest, as he said _to the other_, As I have sworn in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. 

###### 4 
For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works. 

###### 5 
And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest. 

###### 6 
Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter thereinto, and they to whom it was first preached, entered not therein for unbelief's sake: 

###### 7 
Again he appointed in David a certain day, by Today, after so long a time, saying, as it is said, This day, if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts. 

###### 8 
For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not after this have spoken of another day. 

###### 9 
There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God. 

###### 10 
For he that is entered into his rest, hath also ceased from his own works, as God _did_ from his. 

###### 11 
Let us study therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of disobedience. 

###### 12 
For the word of God _is_ lively, and mighty in operation, and sharper than any two edged sword, and entereth through, even unto the dividing asunder of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints, and the marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts, and the intents of the heart. 

###### 13 
Neither is there any creature, which is not manifest in his sight: but all things _are_ naked and open unto his eyes, with whom we have to do. 

###### 14 
Seeing then that we have a great high Priest, which is entered into heaven, _even_ Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession. 

###### 15 
For we have not an high Priest, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but was in all things tempted in like sort, _yet_ without sin. 

###### 16 
Let us therefore go boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
