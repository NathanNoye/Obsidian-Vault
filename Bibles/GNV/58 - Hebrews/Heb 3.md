###### 1 
Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the Apostle and high Priest of our profession Christ Jesus: 

###### 2 
Who was faithful to him that hath appointed him, even as Moses _was_ in all his house. 

###### 3 
For this man is counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he which hath builded the house, hath more honor than the house. 

###### 4 
For every house is builded of some man, and he that hath built all things, _is_ God. 

###### 5 
Now Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a witness of the things which should be spoken after. 

###### 6 
But Christ _is_ as the Son, over his own house, whose house we are, if we hold fast that confidence and that rejoicing of that hope unto the end. 

###### 7 
Wherefore, as the holy Ghost saith, Today if ye shall hear his voice, 

###### 8 
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of the temptation in the wilderness, 

###### 9 
Where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years long. 

###### 10 
Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They err ever in _their_ heart, neither have they known my ways. 

###### 11 
Therefore I swear in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest. 

###### 12 
Take heed brethren, lest at any time there be in any of you an evil heart, and unfaithful, to depart away from the living God. 

###### 13 
But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. 

###### 14 
For we are made partakers of Christ, if we keep sure unto the end that beginning, wherewith we are upholden, 

###### 15 
So long as it is said, Today if ye hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation. 

###### 16 
For some when they heard, provoked him to anger: howbeit, not all that came out of Egypt by Moses. 

###### 17 
But with whom was he displeased forty years? Was he not displeased with them that sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness? 

###### 18 
And to whom swear he that they should not enter into his rest, but unto them that obeyed not? 

###### 19 
So we see that they could not enter in, because of unbelief.
