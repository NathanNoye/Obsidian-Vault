###### 1 
At sundry times and in divers manners God spake in the old time to _our_ fathers by the Prophets: in these last days he hath spoken unto us by his Son, 

###### 2 
Whom he hath made heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds, 

###### 3 
Who being the brightness of the glory, and the engraved form of his person, and bearing up all things by his mighty word: hath by himself purged our sins: and sitteth at the right hand of the Majesty in the highest places, 

###### 4 
And is made so much more excellent than the Angels, inasmuch as he hath obtained a more excellent Name than they. 

###### 5 
For unto which of the Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day begat I thee? and again, I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son: 

###### 6 
And again, when he bringeth in _his_ first begotten Son into the world, he saith, And let all the Angels of God worship him. 

###### 7 
And of the Angels he saith, He maketh the spirits his messengers, and his ministers a flame of fire. 

###### 8 
But unto the Son _he saith_, O God, thy throne _is_ forever and ever: the scepter of thy kingdom _is_ a scepter of righteousness. 

###### 9 
Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity. Wherefore God, _even_ thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness, above thy fellows. 

###### 10 
And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast established the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands. 

###### 11 
They shall perish, but thou dost remain, and they all shall wax old as doth a garment, 

###### 12 
And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail. 

###### 13 
Unto which also of the Angels said he at any time, Sit at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? 

###### 14 
Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister, for their sakes which shall be heirs of salvation?
