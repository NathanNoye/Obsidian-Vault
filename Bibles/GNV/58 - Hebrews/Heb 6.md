###### 1 
Therefore, leaving the doctrine of the beginning of Christ, let us be led forward unto perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God, 

###### 2 
Of the doctrine of baptisms, and laying on of hands, and of the resurrection from the dead, and of eternal judgment. 

###### 3 
And this will we do if God permit. 

###### 4 
For it is impossible that they which were once lightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the holy Ghost, 

###### 5 
And have tasted of the good word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, 

###### 6 
If they fall away, should be renewed again by repentance: seeing they crucify again to themselves the Son of God, and make a mock of him. 

###### 7 
For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dressed, receiveth blessing of God. 

###### 8 
But that which beareth thorns and briars, _is_ reproved, and is near unto cursing, whose end _is_ to be burned. 

###### 9 
But beloved, we have persuaded ourselves better things of you, and such as accompany salvation, though we thus speak. 

###### 10 
For God _is_ not unrighteous, that he should forget your work, and labor of love, which ye showed toward his Name, in that ye have ministered unto the Saints, and _yet_ minister. 

###### 11 
And we desire that every one of you show the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope unto the end, 

###### 12 
That ye be not slothful, but followers of them, which through faith and patience, inherit the promises. 

###### 13 
For when God made the promise to Abraham, because he had no greater to swear by, he swore by himself, 

###### 14 
Saying, Surely I will abundantly bless thee, and multiply thee marvelously. 

###### 15 
And so after that he had tarried patiently, he enjoyed the promise. 

###### 16 
For men verily swear by him that is greater _than themselves_, and an oath for confirmation is among them an end of all strife. 

###### 17 
So God, willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the stableness of his counsel, bound himself by an oath, 

###### 18 
That by two immutable things, wherein it is impossible that God should lie, we might have strong consolation, which have our refuge to lay hold upon that hope that is set before us, 

###### 19 
Which _hope_ we have, as an anchor of the soul, but sure and steadfast, and it entereth into that which is within the veil. 

###### 20 
Whither the forerunner is for us entered in, _even_ Jesus that is made an high Priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
