###### 1 
For every high Priest is taken from among men, and is ordained for men, in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 

###### 2 
Which is able sufficiently to have compassion on them that are ignorant, and that are out of the way, because that he also is compassed with infirmity, 

###### 3 
And for the same sake he is bound to offer for sins, as well for his own part, as for the peoples. 

###### 4 
And no man taketh this honor unto himself, but he that is called of God, as _was_ Aaron. 

###### 5 
So likewise Christ took not to himself this honor to be made the high Priest, but he that said unto him, Thou art my son, this day begat I thee, _gave it him_. 

###### 6 
As he also in another place speaketh, Thou art a Priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek, 

###### 7 
Who in the days of his flesh did offer up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears unto him, that was able to save him from death, and was also heard in that which he feared. 

###### 8 
And though he were the Son, yet learned he obedience, by the things which he suffered. 

###### 9 
And being consecrated, was made the author of eternal salvation unto all them that obey him: 

###### 10 
And is called of God an high Priest after the order of Melchizedek. 

###### 11 
Of whom we have many things to say, which are hard to be uttered, because ye are dull of hearing. 

###### 12 
For when as concerning the time ye ought to be teachers, yet have ye need again that we teach you what _are_ the first principles of the word of God: and are become such as have need of milk, and not of strong meat. 

###### 13 
For everyone that useth milk, is inexpert in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe. 

###### 14 
But strong meat belongeth to them that are of age, which through long custom have their wits exercised, to discern both good and evil.
