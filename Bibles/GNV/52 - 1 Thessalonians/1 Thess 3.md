###### 1 
Wherefore since we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to remain at Athens alone, 

###### 2 
And have sent Timothy our brother and minister of God, and our labor fellow in the Gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you touching your faith, 

###### 3 
That no man should be moved with these afflictions: for ye yourselves know, that we are appointed thereunto. 

###### 4 
For verily when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulations, even as it came to pass, and ye know it. 

###### 5 
Even for this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent _him_ that I might know of your faith, lest the tempter had tempted you in any sort, and that our labor had been in vain. 

###### 6 
But now lately when Timothy came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and love, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring to see us, as we also _do_ you, 

###### 7 
Therefore brethren, we had consolation in you, in all our affliction and necessity through your faith. 

###### 8 
For now are we alive, if ye stand fast in the Lord. 

###### 9 
For what thanks can we recompense to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice for your sakes before our God, 

###### 10 
Night and day, praying exceedingly, that we might see your face, and might accomplish that which is lacking in your faith? 

###### 11 
Now God himself, even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, guide our journey unto you. 

###### 12 
And the Lord increase you, and make you abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we _do_ toward you: 

###### 13 
To make your hearts stable and unblameable in holiness before God even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints.
