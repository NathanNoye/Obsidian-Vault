###### 1 
But of the times and seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you. 

###### 2 
For ye yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord shall come, even as a thief in the night. 

###### 3 
For when they shall say, Peace and safety, then shall come upon them sudden destruction, as the travail upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. 

###### 4 
But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day shall come on you, as _it were_ a thief. 

###### 5 
Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, neither of darkness. 

###### 6 
Therefore let us not sleep as do others, but let us watch and be sober. 

###### 7 
For they that sleep, sleep in the night, and they that be drunken, are drunken in the night. 

###### 8 
But let us which are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love, and the hope of salvation for an helmet. 

###### 9 
For God hath not appointed us unto wrath, but to obtain salvation by the means of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 10 
Which died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him. 

###### 11 
Wherefore exhort one another, and edify one another, even as ye do. 

###### 12 
Now we beseech you brethren, that ye acknowledge them which labor among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you. 

###### 13 
That ye have them in singular love for their work's sake. Be at peace among yourselves. 

###### 14 
We desire you, brethren, admonish them that are out of order: comfort the feebleminded: bear with the weak: be patient toward all men. 

###### 15 
See that none recompense evil for evil unto any man: but ever follow that which is good, both toward yourselves, and toward all men. 

###### 16 
Rejoice evermore. 

###### 17 
Pray continually. 

###### 18 
In all things, give thanks, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus toward you. 

###### 19 
Quench not the Spirit. 

###### 20 
Despise not prophesying. 

###### 21 
Try all things, _and_ keep that which is good. 

###### 22 
Abstain from all appearance of evil. 

###### 23 
Now the very God of peace sanctify you throughout: and _I pray God_ that your whole spirit and soul and body, may be kept blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 24 
Faithful _is he_ which calleth you, which will also do it. 

###### 25 
Brethren, pray for us. 

###### 26 
Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss. 

###### 27 
I charge you in the Lord, that this Epistle be read unto all the brethren the Saints. 

###### 28 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you, Amen. ¶ The first _Epistle_ unto the Thessalonians written from Athens.
