###### 1 
Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the Church of the Thessalonians, _which is_ in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace _be_ with you, and peace from God our Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 2 
We give God thanks always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers. 

###### 3 
Without ceasing, remembering your effectual faith, and diligent love, and the patience of _your_ hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God, even our Father, 

###### 4 
Knowing, beloved brethren, that ye are elect of God. 

###### 5 
For our Gospel was not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assurance, as ye know after what manner we were among you for your sakes. 

###### 6 
And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, and received the word in much affliction, with joy of the holy Ghost, 

###### 7 
So that ye were as ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and in Achaia. 

###### 8 
For from you sounded out the word of the Lord, not in Macedonia and in Achaia only: but your faith also which is toward God, spread abroad in all quarters, that we need not to speak anything. 

###### 9 
For they themselves show of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God. 

###### 10 
And to look for his son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, _even_ Jesus which delivereth us from that wrath to come.
