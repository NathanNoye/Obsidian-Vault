###### 1 
For ye yourselves know, brethren, that our entrance in unto you was not in vain, 

###### 2 
But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated at Philippi, (as ye know) we were bold in our God, to speak unto you the Gospel of God, with much striving. 

###### 3 
For our exhortation was not by deceit, nor by uncleanness, nor by guile. 

###### 4 
But as we were allowed of God, that the Gospel should be committed _unto us_, so we speak, not as they that please men, but God, which approveth our hearts: 

###### 5 
Neither yet did we ever use flattering words, as ye know, nor colored covetousness, God _is_ record. 

###### 6 
Neither sought we praise of men, neither of you, nor of others, when we might have been chargeable, as the Apostles of Christ. 

###### 7 
But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children. 

###### 8 
Thus being affectioned toward you, our good will was to have dealt unto you, not the Gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us. 

###### 9 
For ye remember, brethren, our labor and travail: for we labored day and night, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, and preached unto you the Gospel of God. 

###### 10 
Ye _are_ witnesses, and God _also_, how holily, and justly, and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe. 

###### 11 
As ye know how that we exhorted you, and comforted, and besought every one of you, (as a father his children.) 

###### 12 
That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory. 

###### 13 
For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, that when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is indeed the word of God, which also worketh in you that believe. 

###### 14 
For brethren, ye are become followers of the Churches of God, which in Judea are in Christ Jesus, because ye have also suffered the same things of your own country men, even as they _have_ of the Jews, 

###### 15 
Who both killed the Lord Jesus and their own Prophets, and have persecuted us away, and God they please not, and are contrary to all men, 

###### 16 
And forbid us to preach unto the Gentiles, that they might be saved, to fulfill their sins always: for the wrath _of God_ is come on them to the utmost. 

###### 17 
Forasmuch, brethren, as we were kept from you for a season, concerning sight, but not in the heart, we enforced the more to see your face with great desire. 

###### 18 
Therefore we would have come unto you (I Paul, at least once or twice) but Satan hindered us. 

###### 19 
For what is our hope or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are not even you it in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming? 

###### 20 
Yea, ye are our glory and joy.
