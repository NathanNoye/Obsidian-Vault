###### 1 
Then the Philistines took the Ark of God and carried it from Ebenezer unto Ashdod, 

###### 2 
Even the Philistines took the Ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon. 

###### 3 
And when they of Ashdod rose the next day in the morning, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face on the ground before the Ark of the Lord, and they took up Dagon, and set him in his place again. 

###### 4 
Also they rose up early in the morning the next day, and behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face on the ground before the Ark of the Lord, and the head of Dagon and the two palms of his hands _were_ cut off upon the threshold: only the stump of Dagon was left to him. 

###### 5 
Therefore the Priests of Dagon, and all that come into Dagon's house, tread not on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, unto this day. 

###### 6 
But the hand of the Lord was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and destroyed them, and smote them with the emerods, _both_ Ashdod, and the coasts thereof. 

###### 7 
And when the men of Ashdod saw this, they said, Let not the Ark of the God of Israel abide with us: for his hand is sore upon us and upon Dagon our god. 

###### 8 
They sent therefore, and gathered all the princes of the Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the Ark of the God of Israel be carried about unto Gath: and they carried the Ark of the God of Israel about. 

###### 9 
And when they had carried it about, the hand of the Lord was against the city with a very great destruction, and he smote the men of the city both small and great, and they had emerods in their secret parts. 

###### 10 
¶ Therefore they sent the Ark of God to Ekron: and as soon as the Ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us to slay us and our people. 

###### 11 
Therefore they sent, and gathered together all the princes of the Philistines, and said, Send away the Ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to his own place, that it slay us not and our people: for there was a destruction _and_ death throughout all the city, _and_ the hand of God was very sore there. 

###### 12 
And the men that died not, were smitten with the emerods: and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
