###### 1 
When Samuel was now become old, he made his sons Judges over Israel, 

###### 2 
(And the name of his eldest son was Joel, and the name of the second Abijah) _even_ Judges in Beersheba. 

###### 3 
And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lucre, and took rewards, and perverted the judgment. 

###### 4 
¶ Wherefore all the Elders of Israel gathered them together, and came to Samuel unto Ramah, 

###### 5 
And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not in thy ways: make us now a King to judge us like all nations. 

###### 6 
But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a King to judge us: and Samuel prayed unto the Lord. 

###### 7 
And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hear the voice of the people in all that they shall say unto thee: for they have not cast thee away, but they have cast me away, that I should not reign over them. 

###### 8 
As they have ever done since I brought them out of Egypt even unto this day, (and have forsaken me, and served other gods) even so do they unto thee. 

###### 9 
Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit, yet testify unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. 

###### 10 
¶ So Samuel told all the words of the Lord unto the people that asked a king of him. 

###### 11 
And he said, This shall be the manner of the king that shall reign over you: he will take your sons, and appoint them to his chariots, and to be his horsemen, and _some_ shall run before his chariot. 

###### 12 
Also he will make them his captains over thousands, and captains over fifties, and to ear his ground, and to reap his harvest, and to make instruments of war, and the things that serve for his chariots. 

###### 13 
He will also take your daughters and make them Apothecaries, and Cooks, and Bakers. 

###### 14 
And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your best Olive trees, and give them to his servants. 

###### 15 
And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards, and give it to his Eunuchs, and to his servants. 

###### 16 
And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and the chief of your young men, and your asses, and put them to his work. 

###### 17 
He will take the tenth of your sheep, and ye shall be his servants. 

###### 18 
And ye shall cry out at that day, because of your king, whom ye have chosen you, and the Lord will not hear you at that day. 

###### 19 
But the people would not hear the voice of Samuel, but did say, Nay, but there shall be a king over us. 

###### 20 
And we also will be like all _other_ nations, and our king shall judge us, and go out before us and fight our battles. 

###### 21 
Therefore when Samuel heard all the words of the people, he rehearsed them in the ears of the Lord. 

###### 22 
And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go every man unto his city.
