###### 1 
I Demand then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid: for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin. 

###### 2 
God hath not cast away his people which he knew before. Know ye not what the Scripture saith of Elijah, how he communeth with God against Israel, saying, 

###### 3 
Lord, they have killed thy Prophets, and dug down thine Altars: and I am left alone, and they seek my life? 

###### 4 
But what saith the answer of God to him? I have reserved unto myself seven thousand men, which have not bowed the knee to Baal. 

###### 5 
Even so then, at this present time is there a remnant according to the election of grace. 

###### 6 
And if _it be_ of grace, it is no more of works: or else were grace no more grace: but if it be of works, it is no more grace: or else were work no more work. 

###### 7 
What then? Israel hath not obtained that he sought: but the election hath obtained it, and the rest have been hardened, 

###### 8 
According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber: eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear unto this day. 

###### 9 
And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a net, and a stumbling block, even for a recompense unto them. 

###### 10 
Let their eyes be darkened that they see not, and bow down their back always. 

###### 11 
I demand then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid: but through their fall, salvation _cometh_ unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to follow them. 

###### 12 
Wherefore if the fall of them _be_ the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles, how much more shall their abundance _be?_ 

###### 13 
For _in that_ I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office, 

###### 14 
_To try_ if by any means I might provoke them of my flesh to follow them, and might save some of them. 

###### 15 
For if the casting away of them _be_ the reconciling of the world, what _shall_ the receiving _be_, but life from the dead? 

###### 16 
For if the firstfruits _be_ holy, so _is_ the whole lump: and if the root be holy, so _are_ the branches. 

###### 17 
And though some of the branches be broken off, and thou being a wild Olive tree, wast grafted in for them, and made partaker of the root and fatness of the Olive tree: 

###### 18 
Boast not thyself against the branches: and if thou boast thyself, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee. 

###### 19 
Thou wilt say then, The branches are broken off, that I might be grafted in. 

###### 20 
Well: through unbelief they are broken off, and thou standest by faith: be not high-minded, but fear. 

###### 21 
For if God spared not the natural branches, _take heed_, lest he also spare not thee. 

###### 22 
Behold therefore the bountifulness, and severity of God: toward them which have fallen, severity: but toward thee, bountifulness, if thou continue in _his_ bountifulness: or else thou shalt also be cut off. 

###### 23 
And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again. 

###### 24 
For if thou wast cut out of the Olive tree, which was wild by nature, and was grafted contrary to nature in a right Olive tree, how much more shall they that are by nature, be grafted in their own Olive tree? 

###### 25 
For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this secret (lest ye should be arrogant in yourselves) that partly obstinacy is come to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. 

###### 26 
And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written, The deliverer shall come out of Zion, and shall turn away the ungodliness from Jacob. 

###### 27 
And this is my covenant to them, When I shall take away their sins. 

###### 28 
As concerning the Gospel, _they are_ enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes. 

###### 29 
For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. 

###### 30 
For even as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief: 

###### 31 
Even so now have they not believed by the mercy _showed_ unto you, that they also may obtain mercy. 

###### 32 
For God hath shut up all in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all. 

###### 33 
O the deepness of the riches, both of the wisdom, and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out! 

###### 34 
For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who was his counselor? 

###### 35 
Or who hath given unto him first, and he shall be recompensed? 

###### 36 
For of him, and through him, and for him are all things: to him _be_ glory forever. Amen.
