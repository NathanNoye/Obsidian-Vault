###### 1 
Then being justified by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 2 
By whom also through faith we have had this access into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice under the hope of the glory of God. 

###### 3 
Neither _that_ only, but also we rejoice in tribulations, knowing that tribulation bringeth forth patience. 

###### 4 
And patience experience, and experience hope. 

###### 5 
And hope maketh not ashamed, because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which is given unto us. 

###### 6 
For Christ, when we were yet of no strength, at_ his_ time died for the ungodly. 

###### 7 
Doubtless one will scarce die for a righteous man: but yet for a good man it may be that one dare die. 

###### 8 
But God setteth out his love towards us, seeing that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. 

###### 9 
Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. 

###### 10 
For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life, 

###### 11 
And not only _so_, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement. 

###### 12 
Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death went over all men: in whom all men have sinned. 

###### 13 
For unto the time of the Law was sin in the world, but sin is not imputed, while there is no law. 

###### 14 
But death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them also that sinned not after the like manner of the transgression of Adam, which was the figure of him that was to come. 

###### 15 
But yet the gift is not so as is the offense: for if through the offense of that one, many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many. 

###### 16 
Neither is the gift _so_, as _that which entered in_ by one that sinned: for the fault _came_ of one _offense_ unto condemnation: but the gift _is_ of many offenses to justification. 

###### 17 
For if by the offense of one, death reigned through one, much more shall they which receive that abundance of grace, and of that gift of that righteousness, reign in life through one, _that is_, Jesus Christ. 

###### 18 
Likewise then, as by the offense of one, the _fault came_ on all men to condemnation, so by the justifying of one, _the benefit abounded_ toward all men to the justification of life. 

###### 19 
For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by that obedience of that one, shall many also be made righteous. 

###### 20 
Moreover, the Law entered thereupon, that the offense should abound: nevertheless, where sin abounded, _there_ grace abounded much more: 

###### 21 
That as sin had reigned unto death, so might grace also reign by righteousness unto eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
