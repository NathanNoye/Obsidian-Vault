###### 1 
Now then there _is_ no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 

###### 2 
For the Law of the Spirit of life _which is_ in Christ Jesus, hath freed me from the Law of sin and of death. 

###### 3 
For (that that was impossible to the Law, inasmuch as it was weak, because of the flesh) God sending his own Son, in the similitude of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh, 

###### 4 
That that righteousness of the Law might be fulfilled in us, which walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. 

###### 5 
For they that are after the flesh, savor the things of the flesh: but they that are after the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. 

###### 6 
For the wisdom of the flesh _is_ death: but the wisdom of the Spirit _is_ life and peace, 

###### 7 
Because the wisdom of the flesh _is_ enmity against God: for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. 

###### 8 
So then they that are in the flesh, cannot please God. 

###### 9 
Now ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, because the spirit of God dwelleth in you: but if any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, the same is not his. 

###### 10 
And if Christ be in you, the body is dead, because of sin: but the Spirit _is_ life for righteousness sake. 

###### 11 
But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead, shall also quicken your mortal bodies, by his Spirit that dwelleth in you. 

###### 12 
Therefore brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh, to live after the flesh: 

###### 13 
For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye mortify the deeds of the body by the Spirit, ye shall live. 

###### 14 
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. 

###### 15 
For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage, to fear again: but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father. 

###### 16 
The same Spirit beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God. 

###### 17 
If _we be_ children, _we are_ also heirs, even the heirs of God, and heirs annexed with Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. 

###### 18 
For I count that the afflictions of this present time _are_ not worthy of the glory, which shall be showed unto us. 

###### 19 
For the fervent desire of the creature waiteth when the sons of God shall be revealed, 

###### 20 
Because the creature is subject to vanity, not of its own will, but by reason of him, which hath subdued it under hope, 

###### 21 
Because the creature also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God. 

###### 22 
For we know that every creature groaneth with us also, and travaileth in pain together unto this present. 

###### 23 
And not only _the creature_, but we also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we do sigh in ourselves, waiting for the adoption, _even_ the redemption of our body. 

###### 24 
For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen, is not hope: for how can a man hope for that which he seeth? 

###### 25 
But if we hope for that we see not, we do with patience abide for it. 

###### 26 
Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what to pray as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh request for us with sighs, which cannot be expressed. 

###### 27 
But he that searcheth the hearts, knoweth what is the meaning of the Spirit: for he maketh request for the Saints, according to _the will of_ God. 

###### 28 
Also we know that all things work together for the best unto them that love God, even to them that are called of _his_ purpose. 

###### 29 
For those which he knew before, he also predestinated to be made like to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. 

###### 30 
Moreover, whom he predestinated, them also he called, and whom he called, them also he justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified. 

###### 31 
What shall we then say to these things? If God be on our side, who _can be_ against us? 

###### 32 
Who spared not his own Son, but gave him for us all _to death_, how shall he not with him give us all things also? 

###### 33 
Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's chosen? _it is_ God that justifieth. 

###### 34 
Who shall condemn? _it is_ Christ which is dead: yea, or rather, which is risen again, who is also at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for us. 

###### 35 
Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? 

###### 36 
As it is written, For thy sake are we killed all day long: we are counted as sheep for the slaughter: 

###### 37 
Nevertheless, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us. 

###### 38 
For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 

###### 39 
Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
