###### 1 
I Commend unto you Phoebe our sister, which is a servant of the Church of Cenchrea: 

###### 2 
That ye receive her in the Lord, as it becometh Saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she needeth of your aid: for she hath given hospitality unto many, and to me also. 

###### 3 
Greet Priscilla, and Aquila, my fellow helpers in Christ Jesus. 

###### 4 
(Which have for my life laid down their own neck. Unto whom not I only give thanks, but also all the Churches of the Gentiles.) 

###### 5 
Likewise _greet_ the Church that is in their house. Salute my beloved Epaenetus, which is the firstfruits of Achaia in Christ. 

###### 6 
Greet Mary which bestowed much labor on us. 

###### 7 
Salute Andronicus and Junia my cousins and fellow prisoners, which are notable among the Apostles, and were in Christ before me. 

###### 8 
Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord. 

###### 9 
Salute Urbanus our fellow helper in Christ, and Stachys my beloved. 

###### 10 
Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' _friends_. 

###### 11 
Salute Herodion my kinsman. Greet them which are of the _friends_ of Narcissus which are in the Lord. 

###### 12 
Salute Tryphena and Tryphosa, which _women_ labor in the Lord. Salute the beloved Persis, which _woman_ hath labored much in the Lord. 

###### 13 
Salute Rufus chosen in the Lord, and his mother and mine. 

###### 14 
Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Mercurius, and the brethren which are with them. 

###### 15 
Salute Philologus and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas and all the Saints which are with them. 

###### 16 
Salute one another with an holy kiss. The Churches of Christ salute you. 

###### 17 
¶ Now I beseech you brethren, mark them diligently which cause division and offenses, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them. 

###### 18 
For they that are such, serve not the Lord Jesus Christ but their own bellies, and with fair speech and flattering deceive the hearts of the simple. 

###### 19 
For your obedience is come abroad among all: I am glad therefore of you: but yet I would have you wise unto that which is good, and simple concerning evil. 

###### 20 
The God of peace shall tread Satan under your feet shortly. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you. 

###### 21 
Timothy my helper, and Lucius and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen, salute you. 

###### 22 
I Tertius, which wrote out this Epistle, salute you in the Lord. 

###### 23 
Gaius mine host, and of the whole Church saluteth you. Erastus the steward of the city saluteth you, and Quartus a brother. 

###### 24 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you all, Amen. 

###### 25 
To him now that is of power to establish you according to my Gospel, and preaching of Jesus Christ, by the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began: 

###### 26 
(But now is opened, and published among all nations by the Scriptures of the Prophets, at the commandment of the everlasting God for the obedience of faith.) 

###### 27 
To God, _I say_, only wise, be praise through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen. Written to the Romans from Corinth, _and sent_ by Phoebe, servant of the Church which is at Cenchrea.
