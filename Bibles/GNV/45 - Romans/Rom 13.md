###### 1 
Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers: for there is no power but of God: and the powers that be, are ordained of God. 

###### 2 
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist, shall receive to themselves condemnation. 

###### 3 
For Magistrates are not to be feared _for_ good works, but _for_ evil. Wilt thou then be without fear of the power? do well: so shalt thou have praise of the same. 

###### 4 
For he is the minister of God for thy wealth: but if thou do evil, fear: for he beareth not the sword for nought: for he is the minister of God to take vengeance on him that doeth evil. 

###### 5 
Wherefore ye must be subject, not because of wrath only, but also for conscience sake. 

###### 6 
For, for this cause ye pay also tribute: for they are God's ministers, applying themselves for the same thing. 

###### 7 
Give to all men therefore their duty: tribute, to whom _ye owe_ tribute: custom, to whom custom: fear, to whom fear: honor, to whom _ye owe_ honor. 

###### 8 
Owe nothing to any man, but to love one another: for he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the Law. 

###### 9 
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet: and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, _even_ in this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 

###### 10 
Love doeth not evil to his neighbor: therefore is love the fulfilling of the Law. 

###### 11 
And that, considering the season, that _it is_ now time that we should arise from sleep: for now is our salvation nearer, than when we believed it. 

###### 12 
The night is past, and the day is at hand, let us therefore cast away the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light, 

###### 13 
So that we walk honestly, as in the day: not in gluttony, and drunkenness, neither in chambering and wantonness, nor in strife and envying. 

###### 14 
But put ye on the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and take no thought for the flesh, to _fulfill_ the lust of it.
