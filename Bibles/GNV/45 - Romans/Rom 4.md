###### 1 
What shall we say then, that Abraham our father hath found concerning the flesh? 

###### 2 
For if Abraham were justified by works, he hath wherein to rejoice, but not with God. 

###### 3 
For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. 

###### 4 
Now to him that worketh, the wages is not counted by favor, but by debt: 

###### 5 
But to him that worketh not, but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness. 

###### 6 
Even as David declareth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, _saying_, 

###### 7 
Blessed _are_ they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. 

###### 8 
Blessed _is_ the man to whom the Lord imputeth not sin. 

###### 9 
_Came_ this blessedness then upon the circumcision _only_, or upon the uncircumcision also? For we say, that faith was imputed unto Abraham for righteousness. 

###### 10 
How was it then imputed? when he was circumcised, or uncircumcised? not when he was circumcised, but when he was uncircumcised. 

###### 11 
After, he received the sign of circumcision, _as_ the seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had, when he was uncircumcised, that he should be the father of all them that believe, not being circumcised, that righteousness might be imputed to them also. 

###### 12 
And the father of circumcision, not unto them only which are of the circumcision, but unto them also that walk in the steps of the faith of our father Abraham _which he had_ when he was uncircumcised. 

###### 13 
For the promise that he should be the heir of the world, was not _given_ to Abraham, or to his seed, through the Law, but through the righteousness of faith. 

###### 14 
For if they which are of the Law, _be_ heirs, faith is made void, and the promise is made of none effect. 

###### 15 
For the Law causeth wrath: for where no Law is, there _is_ no transgression. 

###### 16 
Therefore _it is_ by faith, that _it might come_ by grace, and the promise might be sure to all the seed, not to that only which is of the Law: but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all, 

###### 17 
(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations) _even_ before God whom he believed, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not, as though they were. 

###### 18 
Which _Abraham_ above hope, believed under hope, that he should be the father of many nations: according to that which was spoken _to him_, So shall thy seed be. 

###### 19 
And he not weak in the faith, considered not his own body, which was now dead, being almost an hundred years old, neither the deadness of Sarah's womb. 

###### 20 
Neither did he doubt of the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in the faith, and gave glory to God, 

###### 21 
Being fully assured that he which had promised, was also able to do it. 

###### 22 
And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness. 

###### 23 
Now is it not written for him only, that it was imputed to him for righteousness, 

###### 24 
But also for us, to whom it shall be imputed _for righteousness_, which believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, 

###### 25 
Who was delivered _to death_ for our sins, and is risen again for our justification.
