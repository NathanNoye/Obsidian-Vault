###### 1 
I Beseech you therefore brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye give up your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, _which is_ your reasonable serving of God. 

###### 2 
And fashion not yourselves like unto this world, but be ye changed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what that good, and acceptable and perfect will of God is. 

###### 3 
For I say through the grace that is given unto me, to everyone that is among you, that no man presume to understand above that which is meet to understand, but that he understand according to sobriety, as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith. 

###### 4 
For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not one office, 

###### 5 
So we being many, are one body in Christ, and every one, one anothers members. 

###### 6 
Seeing then that we have gifts that are divers, according to the grace that is given unto us, whether _we have_ prophecy, _let us prophesy_ according to the portion of faith. 

###### 7 
Or an office, _let us wait_ on the office: or he that teacheth, on teaching: 

###### 8 
Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that distributeth, _let him do it_ with simplicity: he that ruleth, with diligence: he that showeth mercy, with cheerfulness. 

###### 9 
_Let _love_ be_ without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil, and cleave unto that which is good. 

###### 10 
Be affectioned to love one another with brotherly love. In giving honor, go one before another. 

###### 11 
Not slothful to do service, fervent in spirit serving the Lord, 

###### 12 
Rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing in prayer. 

###### 13 
Distributing unto the necessities of the Saints: giving yourselves to hospitality. 

###### 14 
Bless them which persecute you: bless, _I say_, and curse not. 

###### 15 
Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep. 

###### 16 
Be like affectioned one towards another: be not high-minded: but make yourselves equal to them of the lower sort: be not wise in yourselves. 

###### 17 
Recompense to no man evil for evil: procure things honest in the sight of all men. 

###### 18 
If it be possible, as much as in you is, have peace with all men. 

###### 19 
Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine: I will repay, saith the Lord. 

###### 20 
Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him: if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. 

###### 21 
Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with goodness.
