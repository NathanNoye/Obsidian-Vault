###### 1 
Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the Law) that the Law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth? 

###### 2 
For the woman which is in subjection to a man, is bound by the Law to the man, while he liveth: but if the man be dead, she is delivered from the Law of the man. 

###### 3 
So then, if while the man liveth, she taketh another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if the man be dead, she is free from the Law, so that she is not an adulteress, though she take another man. 

###### 4 
So ye, my brethren, are dead also to the Law by the body of Christ, that ye should be unto another, _even_ unto him that is raised up from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God. 

###### 5 
For when we were in the flesh, the affections of sins, which were by the law, had force in our members, to bring forth fruit unto death, 

###### 6 
But now we are delivered from the Law, he being dead in whom we were holden, that we should serve in newness of Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter. 

###### 7 
What shall we say then? _Is_ the Law sin? God forbid. Nay, I knew not sin, but by the Law: for I had not known lust, except the Law had said, Thou shalt not lust. 

###### 8 
But sin took an occasion by the commandment, and wrought in me all manner of concupiscence: for without the Law sin _is_ dead. 

###### 9 
For I once was alive, without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived, 

###### 10 
But I died: and the same commandment which was _ordained_ unto life, was found _to be_ unto me unto death. 

###### 11 
For sin took occasion by the commandment, and deceived me, and thereby slew _me_. 

###### 12 
Wherefore the Law _is_ holy, and that commandment _is_ holy, and just, and good. 

###### 13 
Was that then which is good, made death unto me? God forbid: but sin, that it might appear sin, wrought death in me by that which is good, that sin might be out of measure sinful by the commandment. 

###### 14 
For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. 

###### 15 
For I allow not that which I do: for what I would, that do I not: but what I hate, that do I. 

###### 16 
If I do then that which I would not, I consent to the Law, that _it is_ good. 

###### 17 
Now then, it is no more I, that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me. 

###### 18 
For I know, that in me, that is, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me: but I find no means to perform that which is good, 

###### 19 
For I do not the good thing, which I would, but the evil, which I would not, that do I. 

###### 20 
Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but the sin that dwelleth in me. 

###### 21 
I find then that when I would do good, I am thus yoked, that evil is present with me. 

###### 22 
For I delight in the Law of God, concerning the inner man. 

###### 23 
But I see another Law in my members, rebelling against the law of my mind, and leading me captive unto the law of sin, which is in my members. 

###### 24 
O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death! 

###### 25 
I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Then I myself in my mind serve the Law of God, but in my flesh the law of sin.
