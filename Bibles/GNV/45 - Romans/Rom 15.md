###### 1 
We which are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves. 

###### 2 
_Therefore_ let every man please his neighbor in that that is good to edification. 

###### 3 
For Christ also would not please himself, but as it is written, The rebukes of them which rebuke thee, fell on me. 

###### 4 
For whatsoever things are written aforetime, are written for our learning, that we through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope. 

###### 5 
Now the God of patience and consolation give you that ye be like-minded one towards another, according to Christ Jesus, 

###### 6 
That ye with one mind, _and_ with one mouth may praise God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 7 
Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God. 

###### 8 
Now I say, that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision, for the truth of God, to confirm the promises _made_ unto the fathers. 

###### 9 
And let the Gentiles praise God, for _his_ mercy, as it is written, For this cause I will confess thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy Name. 

###### 10 
And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles with his people. 

###### 11 
And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles, and laud ye him all people together. 

###### 12 
And again Isaiah saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles, in him shall the Gentiles trust. 

###### 13 
Now the God of hope fill you with all joy, and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the holy Ghost. 

###### 14 
And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that ye also are full of goodness, and filled with all knowledge, and are able to admonish one another. 

###### 15 
Nevertheless, brethren, I have somewhat boldly after a sort written unto you, as one that putteth you in remembrance, through the grace that is given me of God, 

###### 16 
That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ toward the Gentiles, ministering the Gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy Ghost. 

###### 17 
I have therefore whereof I may rejoice in Christ Jesus in those things which _pertain_ to God. 

###### 18 
For I dare not speak of anything, which Christ hath not wrought by me, _to make_ the Gentiles obedient in word and deed, 

###### 19 
With the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the spirit of God: so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have caused to abound the Gospel of Christ. 

###### 20 
Yea, so I enforced myself to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should have built on another man's foundation. 

###### 21 
But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see _him_, and they that heard not, shall understand _him_. 

###### 22 
Therefore also I have been oft let to come unto you: 

###### 23 
But now seeing I have no more place in these quarters, and also have been desirous many years agone to come unto you, 

###### 24 
When I shall take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, after that I have been somewhat filled with your _company_. 

###### 25 
But now go I to Jerusalem, to minister unto the Saints. 

###### 26 
For it hath pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia, to make a certain distribution unto the poor Saints which are at Jerusalem. 

###### 27 
For it hath pleased them, and their debtors are they: for if the Gentiles be made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things. 

###### 28 
When I have therefore performed this, and have sealed them this fruit, I will pass by you into Spain. 

###### 29 
And I know when I come, that I shall come to you with abundance of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ. 

###### 30 
Also brethren, I beseech you for our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, and for the love of the spirit, that ye would strive with me by prayers to God for me, 

###### 31 
That I may be delivered from them which are disobedient in Judea, and that my service which I have to do at Jerusalem, may be accepted of the Saints, 

###### 32 
That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed. 

###### 33 
Thus the God of peace _be_ with you all. Amen.
