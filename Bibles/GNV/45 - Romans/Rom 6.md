###### 1 
What shall we say then? Shall we continue still in sin, that grace may abound? God forbid. 

###### 2 
How shall we, that are dead to sin, live yet therein? 

###### 3 
Know ye not, that all we which have been baptized into Jesus Christ, have been baptized into his death? 

###### 4 
We are buried then with him by baptism into his death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead to the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life. 

###### 5 
For if we be planted with him to the similitude of his death, even so shall we be _to the similitude_ of his resurrection, 

###### 6 
Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin, 

###### 7 
For he that is dead, is freed from sin. 

###### 8 
Wherefore, if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall live also with him, 

###### 9 
Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more: death hath no more dominion over him. 

###### 10 
For in that he died, he died once to sin: but in that he liveth, he liveth to God. 

###### 11 
Likewise think ye also, that ye are dead to sin, but are alive to God in Jesus Christ our Lord. 

###### 12 
Let not sin reign therefore in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof: 

###### 13 
Neither give ye your members, _as_ weapons of unrighteousness unto sin: but give yourselves unto God, as they that are alive from the dead, and _give_ your members _as_ weapons of righteousness unto God. 

###### 14 
For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the Law, but under grace. 

###### 15 
What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the Law, but under grace? God forbid. 

###### 16 
Know ye not, that to whomsoever ye give yourselves as servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey, whether it be of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? 

###### 17 
But God _be_ thanked, that ye have been the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart unto the form of the doctrine, whereunto ye were delivered. 

###### 18 
Being then made free from sin, ye are made the servants of righteousness. 

###### 19 
I speak after the manner of man, because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have given your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity, to _commit_ iniquity, so now give your members servants unto righteousness in holiness. 

###### 20 
For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were freed from righteousness. 

###### 21 
What fruit had ye then in those things, whereof ye are now ashamed? For the end of those things _is_ death. 

###### 22 
But now being freed from sin, and made servants unto God, ye have your fruit in holiness, and the end, everlasting life. 

###### 23 
For the wages of sin is death: but the gift of God _is_ eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
