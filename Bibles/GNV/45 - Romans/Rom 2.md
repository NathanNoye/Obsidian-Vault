###### 1 
Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that condemnest: for in that thou condemnest another, thou condemnest thyself: for thou that condemnest, doest the same things. 

###### 2 
But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth, against them which commit such things. 

###### 3 
And thinkest thou this, O thou man, that condemnest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God? 

###### 4 
Or despisest thou the riches of his bountifulness, and patience, and long sufferance, not knowing that the bountifulness of God leadeth thee to repentance? 

###### 5 
But thou, after thine hardness, and heart that cannot repent, heapest up as a treasure unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath, and of the declaration of the just judgment of God, 

###### 6 
Who will reward every man according to his works: 

###### 7 
_That is_, to them which through patience in well doing, seek glory, and honor, and immortality, everlasting life: 

###### 8 
But unto them that are contentious, and disobey the truth, and obey unrighteousness, _shall be_ indignation and wrath. 

###### 9 
Tribulation and anguish _shall be_ upon the soul of every man that doeth evil: of the Jew first, and _also_ of the Grecian. 

###### 10 
But to every man that doeth good, _shall be_ glory, and honor, and peace: to the Jew first, and _also_ to the Grecian. 

###### 11 
For there is no respect of persons with God. 

###### 12 
For as many as have sinned without the Law, shall perish also without the Law: and as many as have sinned in the Law, shall be judged by the Law, 

###### 13 
(For the hearers of the Law _are_ not righteous before God: but the doers of the Law shall be justified. 

###### 14 
For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things _contained_ in the Law, they having not the Law, are a Law unto themselves, 

###### 15 
Which show the effect of the Law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness and their thoughts accusing one another, or excusing.) 

###### 16 
At the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel. 

###### 17 
¶ Behold, thou art called a Jew, and restest in the Law, and gloriest in God, 

###### 18 
And knowest _his_ will, and triest the things that dissent from it, in that thou art instructed by the Law: 

###### 19 
And persuadest thyself that thou art a guide of the blind, a light of them which _are_ in darkness, 

###### 20 
An instructor of them which lack discretion, a teacher of the unlearned, which hast the form of knowledge, and of the truth in the law. 

###### 21 
Thou therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest, A man should not steal, dost thou steal? 

###### 22 
Thou that sayest, A man should not commit adultery, dost thou commit adultery? thou that abhorrest idols, committest thou sacrilege? 

###### 23 
Thou that gloriest in the Law, through breaking the Law, dishonorest thou God? 

###### 24 
For the Name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written. 

###### 25 
For circumcision verily is profitable, if thou do the Law: but if thou be a transgressor of the Law, thy circumcision is made uncircumcision. 

###### 26 
Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the ordinances of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision? 

###### 27 
And shall not uncircumcision which is by nature (if it keep the Law) condemn thee which by the letter and circumcision _art_ a transgressor of the Law? 

###### 28 
For he is not a Jew, which is one outward: neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh: 

###### 29 
But he is a Jew which is one within, and the circumcision _is_ of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
