###### 1 
Him that is weak in the faith, receive unto you, _but_ not for controversies of disputations. 

###### 2 
One believeth that he may eat of all things: and another, which is weak, eateth herbs. 

###### 3 
Let not him that eateth, despise him that eateth not: and let not him which eateth not, condemn him that eateth: for God hath received him. 

###### 4 
Who art thou that condemnest another man's servant? he standeth or falleth to his own master: yea, he shall be established: for God is able to make him stand. 

###### 5 
This man esteemeth one day above another day, and another man counteth every day alike: let every man be fully persuaded in his mind. 

###### 6 
He that observeth the day, observeth it to the Lord: and he that observeth not the day, observeth it not to the Lord. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord: for he giveth God thanks: and he that eateth not, eateth not to the Lord, and giveth God thanks. 

###### 7 
For none of us liveth to himself, neither doth any die to himself. 

###### 8 
For whether we live, we live unto the Lord: or whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lords. 

###### 9 
For Christ therefore died and rose again, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the quick. 

###### 10 
But why dost thou condemn thy brother? or why dost thou despise thy brother? for we shall all appear before the judgment seat of Christ. 

###### 11 
For it is written, I live, saith the Lord, and every knee shall bow to me, and all tongues shall confess unto God. 

###### 12 
So then everyone of us shall give accounts of himself to God. 

###### 13 
Let us not therefore judge one another anymore: but use _your_ judgment rather in this that no man put an occasion to fall, or a stumbling block before _his_ brother. 

###### 14 
I know, and am persuaded through the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but unto him that judgeth anything to be unclean, to him _it is_ unclean. 

###### 15 
But if thy brother be grieved for the meat, now walkest thou not charitably: destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died. 

###### 16 
Cause not your commodity to be evil spoken of. 

###### 17 
For the kingdom of God, is not meat nor drink, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghost. 

###### 18 
For whosoever in these things serveth Christ, is acceptable unto God, and is approved of men. 

###### 19 
Let us then follow those things which concern peace, and wherewith one may edify another. 

###### 20 
Destroy not the work of God for meat's sake: all things indeed are pure: but _it is_ evil for the man which eateth with offense. 

###### 21 
_It is_ good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or made weak. 

###### 22 
Hast thou faith? have it with thyself before God: blessed _is_ he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth. 

###### 23 
For he that doubteth, is condemned if he eat, because _he eateth_ not of faith: and whatsoever is not of faith, is sin.
