###### 1 
Let a man so think of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and disposers of the secrets of God: 

###### 2 
And as for the rest, it is required of the disposers, that every man be found faithful. 

###### 3 
As touching me, I pass very little to be judged of you, or of man's judgment: no, I judge not mine own self. 

###### 4 
For I know nothing by myself, yet am I not thereby justified: but he that judgeth me, is the Lord. 

###### 5 
Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who will lighten things that are hid in darkness, and make the counsels of the hearts manifest: and then shall every man have praise of God. 

###### 6 
Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied unto mine own self and Apollos, for your sakes, that ye might learn by us, that no man presume above that which is written, that one swell not against another for any man's cause. 

###### 7 
For who separateth thee? and what hast thou, that thou hast not received? if thou hast received it, why rejoicest thou, as though thou hadst not received it? 

###### 8 
Now ye are full: now ye are made rich: ye reign as kings without us, and would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. 

###### 9 
For I think that God hath set forth us the last Apostles, as men appointed to death, for we are made a gassing stock unto the world, and to the Angels, and to men. 

###### 10 
We _are_ fools for Christ's sake, and ye _are_ wise in Christ: we _are_ weak, and ye _are_ strong: ye _are_ honorable, and we _are_ despised. 

###### 11 
Unto this hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place, 

###### 12 
And labor, working with our own hands: we are reviled, and _yet_ we bless: we are persecuted, _and_ suffer it. 

###### 13 
We are evil spoken of, and we pray: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things, unto this time. 

###### 14 
I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish you. 

###### 15 
For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet _have ye_ not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the Gospel. 

###### 16 
Wherefore, I pray you, be followers of me. 

###### 17 
For this cause have I sent unto you Timothy, which is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, which shall put you in remembrance of my ways in Christ as I teach everywhere in every Church. 

###### 18 
Some are puffed up as though I would not come unto you. 

###### 19 
But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and I will know, not the words of them which are puffed up, but the power. 

###### 20 
For the kingdom of God _is_ not in word, but in power. 

###### 21 
What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?
