###### 1 
It is heard certainly _that there is_ fornication among you: and such fornication as is not once named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife. 

###### 2 
And ye are puffed up, and have not rather sorrowed, that he which hath done this deed, might be put from among you. 

###### 3 
For I verily as absent in body, but present in spirit, have determined already as though I were present, that he that hath thus done this thing, 

###### 4 
When ye are gathered together, and my spirit, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that such one, _I say_, by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 5 
Be delivered unto Satan, for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus. 

###### 6 
Your rejoicing is not good: know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump? 

###### 7 
Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened: for Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us. 

###### 8 
Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither in the leaven of maliciousness and wickedness: but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. 

###### 9 
I wrote unto you in an Epistle, that ye should not company together with fornicators, 

###### 10 
And not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or with extortioners, or with idolaters: for then ye must go out of the world. 

###### 11 
But now I have written unto you, that ye company not together: if any that is called a brother, be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such one eat not. 

###### 12 
For what have I to do to judge them also which are without? do ye not judge them that are within? 

###### 13 
But God judgeth them that are without. Put away therefore from among yourselves that wicked man.
