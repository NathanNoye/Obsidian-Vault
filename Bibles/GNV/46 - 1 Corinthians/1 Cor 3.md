###### 1 
And I could not speak unto you, brethren, as unto spiritual men, but as unto carnal, _even_ as unto babes in Christ. 

###### 2 
I gave you milk to drink, and not meat: for ye were not yet able _to bear it_, neither yet now are ye able. 

###### 3 
For ye are yet carnal: for whereas _there is_ among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? 

###### 4 
For when one saith, I am Paul's, and another, I am Apollos's, are ye not carnal? 

###### 5 
Who is Paul then? and who is Apollos, but the ministers by whom ye believed, and as the Lord gave to every man? 

###### 6 
I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. 

###### 7 
So then, neither is he that planteth anything, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase. 

###### 8 
And he that planteth, and he that watereth, are one, and every man shall receive his wages, according to his labor. 

###### 9 
For we together are God's laborers: ye are God's husbandry, _and_ God's building. 

###### 10 
According to the grace of God given to me, as a skillful master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon: but let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it. 

###### 11 
For other foundation can no man lay, than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. 

###### 12 
And if any man build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, timber, hay, _or_ stubble, 

###### 13 
Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by the fire: and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. 

###### 14 
If any man's work, that he hath built upon, abide, he shall receive wages. 

###### 15 
If any man's work burn, he shall lose, but he shall be saved himself: nevertheless yet as it were by the fire. 

###### 16 
Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you? 

###### 17 
If any man destroy the Temple of God, him shall God destroy: for the Temple of God is holy, which ye are. 

###### 18 
Let no man deceive himself: If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him be a fool, that he may be wise. 

###### 19 
For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God: for it is written, He catcheth the wise in their own craftiness. 

###### 20 
And again, The Lord knoweth that the thoughts of the wise be vain. 

###### 21 
Therefore let no man rejoice in men: for all things are yours. 

###### 22 
Whether it be Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, whether they be things present, or things to come, _even_ all are yours, 

###### 23 
And ye Christ's, and Christ God's.
