###### 1 
And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of words, or of wisdom, showing unto you the testimony of God. 

###### 2 
For I esteemed not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified. 

###### 3 
And I was among you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling. 

###### 4 
Neither _stood _my word, and my preaching in the enticing speech of man's wisdom, but in plain evidence of the Spirit and of power. 

###### 5 
That your faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. 

###### 6 
And we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: not the wisdom of this world, neither of the princes of this world, which come to nought. 

###### 7 
But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, _even_ the hid _wisdom_, which God had determined before the world, unto our glory. 

###### 8 
Which none of the princes of this world hath known: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. 

###### 9 
But as it is written, The things which eye hath not seen, neither ear hath heard, neither came into man's heart, _are_, which God hath prepared for them that love him. 

###### 10 
But God hath revealed _them_ unto us by his Spirit: for the spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God. 

###### 11 
For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of a man, which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. 

###### 12 
Now we have receiveth not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit, which is of God, that we might know the things that are given to us of God. 

###### 13 
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth, comparing spiritual things with spiritual things. 

###### 14 
But the natural man perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him, neither can he know _them_, because they are spiritually discerned. 

###### 15 
But he that is spiritual, discerneth all things: yet he himself is judged of no man. 

###### 16 
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he might instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.
