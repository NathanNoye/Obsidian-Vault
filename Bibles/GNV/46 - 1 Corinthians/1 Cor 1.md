###### 1 
Paul called _to be_ an Apostle of Jesus Christ, through the will of God, and _ou_r brother Sosthenes, 

###### 2 
Unto the Church of God, which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, Saints by calling, with all that call on the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, both their _Lord_, and ours: 

###### 3 
Grace _be_ with you, and peace from God our Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 4 
I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God, which is given you in Jesus Christ. 

###### 5 
That in all things ye are made rich in him in all kind of speech, and in all knowledge: 

###### 6 
As the testimony of Jesus Christ hath been confirmed in you: 

###### 7 
So that ye are not destitute of any gift: waiting for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 8 
Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. 

###### 9 
God is faithful, by whom ye are called unto the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ our Lord. 

###### 10 
Now I beseech you, brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak one thing, and that there be no dissensions among you: but be ye knit together in one mind, and in one judgment. 

###### 11 
For it hath been declared unto me, my brethren, of you by them that are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you. 

###### 12 
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am Paul's, and I am Apollos's, and I am Cephas's and I am Christ's. 

###### 13 
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? either were ye baptized into the name of Paul? 

###### 14 
I thank God, that I baptized none of you, but Crispus, and Gaius, 

###### 15 
Lest any should say, that I had baptized into mine own name. 

###### 16 
I baptized also the household of Stephanas: furthermore know I not, whether I baptized any other. 

###### 17 
For CHRIST sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect. 

###### 18 
For that preaching of the cross is to them that perish, foolishness: but unto us, which are saved, it is the power of God. 

###### 19 
For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will cast away the understanding of the prudent. 

###### 20 
Where is the wise? where is the Scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made the wisdom of this world foolishness? 

###### 21 
For seeing the world by wisdom knew not God in the wisdom of GOD, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe: 

###### 22 
Seeing also that the Jews require a sign, and the Grecians seek after wisdom. 

###### 23 
But we preach Christ crucified: unto the Jews, even a stumbling block, and unto the Grecians, foolishness: 

###### 24 
But unto them which are called, both of the Jews and Grecians, _we preach_ Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God. 

###### 25 
For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. 

###### 26 
For brethren, you see your calling, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble _are called_. 

###### 27 
But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and God hath chosen the weak things of the world, to confound the mighty things, 

###### 28 
And vile things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are. 

###### 29 
That no flesh should rejoice in his presence. 

###### 30 
But ye are of him in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption. 

###### 31 
That, according as it is written, He that rejoiceth, let him rejoice in the Lord.
