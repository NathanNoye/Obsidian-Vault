###### 1 
And as touching things sacrificed unto idols, we know that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffeth up, but love edifieth. 

###### 2 
Now, if any man think that he knoweth anything, he knoweth nothing, yet as he ought to know. 

###### 3 
But if any man love God, the same is known of him. 

###### 4 
Concerning therefore the eating of things sacrificed unto idols, we know that an idol _is_ nothing in the world, and that there _is_ none other God but one. 

###### 5 
For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven, or in earth (as there be many gods, and many lords.) 

###### 6 
Yet unto us there _is_ but one God, _which is_ that Father, of whom are all things, and we in him, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom _are_ all things, and we by him. 

###### 7 
But every man hath not that knowledge: for many having conscience of the idol, until this hour, eat as a thing sacrificed unto the idol, and so their conscience being weak, is defiled. 

###### 8 
But meat maketh us not acceptable to God, for neither if we eat, have we the more: neither if we eat not, have we the less. 

###### 9 
But take heed lest by any means this power of yours be an occasion of falling, to them that are weak. 

###### 10 
For if any man see thee which hast knowledge, sit at table in the idols' temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak, be boldened, to eat those things which are sacrificed to idols? 

###### 11 
And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died. 

###### 12 
Now when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ. 

###### 13 
Wherefore if meat offend my brother, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, that I may not offend my brother.
