###### 1 
Dare any of you, having business against another, be judged under the unjust, and not under the Saints? 

###### 2 
Do ye not know that the Saints shall judge the world? If the world then shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 

###### 3 
Know ye not that we shall judge the Angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? 

###### 4 
If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them up which are least esteemed in the Church. 

###### 5 
I speak it to your shame. Is it so that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one, that can judge between his brethren? 

###### 6 
But a brother goeth to law with a brother, and that under the infidels. 

###### 7 
Now therefore there is altogether infirmity in you, that ye go to law one with another: why rather suffer ye not wrong? why rather sustain ye not harm? 

###### 8 
Nay, ye yourselves do wrong, and do harm, and that to your brethren. 

###### 9 
Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor wantons, nor buggerers, 

###### 10 
Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor railers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God. 

###### 11 
And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified, in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God. 

###### 12 
¶ All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not profitable. I may do all things, but I will not be brought under the power of any thing. 

###### 13 
Meats _are ordained_ for the belly, and the belly for the meats: but God shall destroy both it, and them. Now the body _is_ not for fornication, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. 

###### 14 
And God hath also raised up the Lord, and shall raise us up by his power. 

###### 15 
Know ye not, that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid. 

###### 16 
Do ye not know, that he which coupleth himself with an harlot, is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh. 

###### 17 
But he that is joined unto the Lord, is one spirit. 

###### 18 
Flee fornication: every sin that a man doeth, is without the body: but he that commiteth fornication, sinneth against his own body. 

###### 19 
Know ye not, that your body is the temple of the holy Ghost, _which is_ in you, whom ye have of God? and ye are not your own. 

###### 20 
For ye are bought for a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit: for they are God's.
