###### 1 
If _there be_ therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any compassion and mercy, 

###### 2 
Fulfill my joy, that ye be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, and of one judgment, 

###### 3 
That nothing _be done_ through contention or vainglory, but that in meekness of mind every man esteem others better than himself. 

###### 4 
Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of other men. 

###### 5 
Let the same mind be in you that was even in Christ Jesus, 

###### 6 
Who being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with God: 

###### 7 
But he made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made like unto men, and was found in shape as a man. 

###### 8 
He humbled himself, and became obedient unto the death, even the death of the cross. 

###### 9 
Wherefore God hath also highly exalted him, and given him a name above every name. 

###### 10 
That at the Name of Jesus should every knee bow, _both_ of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth. 

###### 11 
And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ_ is_ the Lord, unto the glory of God the Father. 

###### 12 
Wherefore my beloved, as ye have always obeyed me, not as in my presence only, but now much more in mine absence, _so_ make an end of your own salvation with fear and trembling. 

###### 13 
For it is God which worketh in you both the will and the deed, _even_ of _his_ good pleasure. 

###### 14 
Do all things without murmuring and reasonings, 

###### 15 
That ye may be blameless, and pure, _and_ the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a naughty and crooked nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, 

###### 16 
Holding forth the word of life, that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither have labored in vain. 

###### 17 
Yea, and though I be offered up upon the sacrifice, and service of your faith, I am glad, and rejoice with you all. 

###### 18 
For the same cause also be ye glad, and rejoice with me. 

###### 19 
And I trust in the Lord Jesus, to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state. 

###### 20 
For I have no man like-minded, who will faithfully care for your matters. 

###### 21 
For all seek their own, _and_ not that which is Jesus Christ's. 

###### 22 
But ye know the proof of him, that as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the Gospel. 

###### 23 
Him therefore I hope to send as soon as I know how it will go with me, 

###### 24 
And I trust in the Lord, that I also myself shall come shortly. 

###### 25 
But I supposed it necessary to send _my_ brother Epaphroditus unto you my companion in labor, and fellow soldier, even your messenger, and he that ministered unto me such things as I wanted. 

###### 26 
For he longed after all you, and was full of heaviness, because ye had heard that he had been sick. 

###### 27 
And no doubt he was sick, very near unto death: but God had mercy on him, and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. 

###### 28 
I sent him therefore the more diligently, that when ye should see him again, ye might rejoice, and I might be the less sorrowful. 

###### 29 
Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness, and make much of such: 

###### 30 
Because that for the work of Christ he was near unto death, and regarded not his life, to fulfill that service which was lacking on your part toward me.
