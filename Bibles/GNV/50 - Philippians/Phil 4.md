###### 1 
Therefore, my brethren, beloved and longed for, _my_ joy and my crown, so continue in the Lord, ye beloved. 

###### 2 
I pray Euodia, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of one accord in the Lord. 

###### 3 
Yea, and I beseech thee, faithful yokefellow, help those _women_, which labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names _are_ in the book of life. 

###### 4 
Rejoice in the Lord always, again I say, rejoice. 

###### 5 
Let your patient mind be known unto all men. The Lord _is_ at hand. 

###### 6 
Be nothing careful, but in all things let your requests be showed unto God in prayer and supplication with giving of thanks. 

###### 7 
And the peace of God which passeth all understanding, shall preserve your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. 

###### 8 
Furthermore, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things _are_ honest, whatsoever things _are_ just, whatsoever things _are_ pure, whatsoever things _are_ worthy love, whatsoever things _are_ of good report, if there _be_ any virtue, or if there _be_ any praise, think on these things. 

###### 9 
Which ye have both learned and received, and heard, and seen in me: those things do, and the God of peace shall be with you. 

###### 10 
Now I rejoice also in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care for me springeth afresh, wherein notwithstanding ye were careful, but ye lacked opportunity. 

###### 11 
I speak not because of want: for I have learned in whatsoever state I am, therewith to be content. 

###### 12 
And I can be abased, and I can abound: everywhere in all things I am instructed, both to be full, and to be hungry, and to abound, and to have want. 

###### 13 
I am able to _do_ all things through the help of Christ, which strengtheneth me. 

###### 14 
Notwithstanding ye have well done, that ye did communicate to mine affliction. 

###### 15 
And ye Philippians know also that in the beginning of the Gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no Church communicated with me, concerning the matter of giving and receiving, but ye only. 

###### 16 
For even _when I was_ in Thessalonica, ye sent once, and afterward again for my necessity. 

###### 17 
Not that I desire a gift: but I desire the fruit which may further your reckoning. 

###### 18 
Now I have received all, and have plenty: I was even filled, after that I had received of Epaphroditus that which _came_ from you, an odor that smelleth sweet, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasant to God. 

###### 19 
And my God shall fulfill all your necessities through his riches with glory in Jesus Christ. 

###### 20 
Unto God even our Father _be_ praise for evermore, Amen. 

###### 21 
Salute all the Saints in Christ Jesus. The brethren, which are with me, greet you. 

###### 22 
All the Saints salute you, and most of all they which are of Caesar's household. 

###### 23 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you all, Amen. ¶Written to the Philippians from Rome, _and sent_ by Epaphroditus.
