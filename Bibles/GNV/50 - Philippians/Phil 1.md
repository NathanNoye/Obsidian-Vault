###### 1 
Paul and Timothy the servants of JESUS CHRIST, to all the Saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the Bishops, and Deacons: 

###### 2 
Grace _be_ with you, and peace from God our Father, and _from_ the Lord Jesus Christ: 

###### 3 
I thank my God, _having_ you in perfect memory, 

###### 4 
(Always in all my prayers for all you, praying with gladness) 

###### 5 
Because of the fellowship which ye have in the Gospel, from the first day unto now. 

###### 6 
And I am persuaded of this same thing, that he that hath begun _this_ good work in you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ, 

###### 7 
As it becometh me so to judge of you all, because I have you in remembrance, that both in my bands, and in _my_ defense, and confirmation of the Gospel you all were partakers of my grace. 

###### 8 
For God is my record, how I long after you all from the very heart root in Jesus Christ. 

###### 9 
And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment, 

###### 10 
That ye may allow those things which are best, that ye may be pure, and without offense, until the day of Christ, 

###### 11 
Filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God. 

###### 12 
¶ I would ye understood, brethren, that the things which _have come_ unto me, are turned rather to the furthering of the Gospel, 

###### 13 
So that my bands in Christ are famous throughout all the judgment hall, and in all other _places_. 

###### 14 
Insomuch that many of the brethren in the Lord are boldened through my bands, and dare more frankly speak the Word. 

###### 15 
Some preach Christ even through envy and strife, and some also of good will. 

###### 16 
The one part preacheth Christ of contention, _and _not purely, supposing to add more affliction to my bands. 

###### 17 
But the others of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the Gospel. 

###### 18 
What then: yet Christ is preached all manner ways, whether _it be_ under a pretence, or sincerely: and I therein joy: yea, and will joy. 

###### 19 
For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and by the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, 

###### 20 
As I fervently look for, and hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all confidence, as always, so now Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether _it be_ by life or by death. 

###### 21 
For Christ _is_ to me both in life and in death advantage. 

###### 22 
And whether to live in the flesh _were_ profitable for me, and what to choose I know not. 

###### 23 
For I am distressed between both, desiring to be loosed and to be with Christ, which is best of all. 

###### 24 
Nevertheless, to abide in the flesh, _is_ more needful for you. 

###### 25 
And this am I sure of, that I shall abide, and with you all continue, for your furtherance and joy of _your_ faith, 

###### 26 
That ye may more abundantly rejoice in JESUS CHRIST for me, by my coming to you again. 

###### 27 
Only let your conversation be as it becometh the Gospel of Christ, that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your matters, that ye continue in one spirit, _and_ in one mind, fighting together through the faith of the Gospel. 

###### 28 
And in nothing fear your adversaries, which is to them a token of perdition, and to you of salvation, and that of God. 

###### 29 
For unto you it is given for Christ, that not only ye should believe in him, but also suffer for his sake, 

###### 30 
Having the same fight, which ye saw in me, and now hear _to be _in me.
