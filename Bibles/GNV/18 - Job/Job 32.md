###### 1 
So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he esteemed himself just. 

###### 2 
Then the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, was kindled: his wrath, _I say_, was kindled against Job, because he justified himself more than God. 

###### 3 
Also his anger was kindled against his three friends, because they could not find an answer, _and_ yet condemned Job. 

###### 4 
(Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken: for they were more ancient in years than he.) 

###### 5 
So when Elihu saw, that there was none answer in the mouth of the three men, his wrath was kindled. 

###### 6 
Therefore Elihu the son of Barachel, the Buzite answered and said, I am young in years, and ye are ancient: therefore I doubted, and was afraid to show you mine opinion. 

###### 7 
_For_ I said, The days shall speak, and the multitude of years shall teach wisdom. 

###### 8 
Surely there is a spirit in man, but the inspiration of the Almighty giveth understanding. 

###### 9 
Great men are not _always_ wise, neither do the aged _always_ understand judgment. 

###### 10 
Therefore I say, Hear me _and_ I will show also mine opinion. 

###### 11 
Behold, I did wait upon your words, _and_ hearkened unto your knowledge, while you sought out reasons. 

###### 12 
Yea, when I had considered you, lo, there was none of you that reproved Job, nor answered his words: 

###### 13 
Lest ye should say, We have found wisdom: _for_ God hath cast him down, _and_ no man. 

###### 14 
Yet hath he not directed _his_ words to me, neither will I answer him by your words. 

###### 15 
_Then_ they fearing, answered no more, _but_ left off their talk. 

###### 16 
When I had waited (for they spake not, but stood still _and_ answered no more) 

###### 17 
_Then_ answered I in my turn, and I showed mine opinion. 

###### 18 
For I am full of matter, _and_ the spirit within me compelleth me. 

###### 19 
Behold, my belly _is_ as the wine, which hath no vent, _and_ like the new bottles that burst. 

###### 20 
_Therefore_ will I speak, that I may take breath: I will open my lips, and will answer. 

###### 21 
I will not now accept the person of man, neither will I give titles to man. 

###### 22 
For I may not give titles, _lest_ my Maker should take me away suddenly.
