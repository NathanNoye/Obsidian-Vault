###### 1 
Then answered the Lord unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

###### 2 
Who is this that darkeneth the counsel by words without knowledge? 

###### 3 
Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

###### 4 
Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding. 

###### 5 
Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest, or who hath stretched the line over it: 

###### 6 
Whereupon are the foundations thereof set: or who laid the cornerstone thereof: 

###### 7 
When the stars of the morning praised _me_ together, and all the children of God rejoiced: 

###### 8 
Or _who_ hath shut up the Sea with doors, when it issued and came forth _as_ out of the womb: 

###### 9 
When I made the clouds _as_ a covering thereof, and darkness _as_ the swaddling bands thereof: 

###### 10 
When I establisheth my commandment upon it, and set bars and doors, 

###### 11 
And said, hitherto shalt thou come, but no further, and here shall it stay thy proud waves. 

###### 12 
Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days? hast thou caused the morning to know his place? 

###### 13 
That it might take hold of the corners of the earth, and that the wicked might be shaken out of it? 

###### 14 
It is turned as clay to fashion, and all stand up as a garment. 

###### 15 
And from the wicked their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken. 

###### 16 
Hast thou entered into the bottoms of the sea? or hast thou walked to seek out the depth? 

###### 17 
Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the gates of the shadow of death? 

###### 18 
Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? tell if thou knowest all this. 

###### 19 
Where is the way _where_ light dwelleth? and where is the place of darkness, 

###### 20 
That thou shouldest receive it in the bounds thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof? 

###### 21 
Knewest thou it, because thou wast then born? and _because_ the number of thy days _is_ great? 

###### 22 
Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail, 

###### 23 
Which I have hid against the time of trouble, against the day of war and battle? 

###### 24 
By what way is the light parted, _which_ scattereth the East wind upon the earth? 

###### 25 
Who hath divided the spouts for the rain? or the way for the lightning of the thunders, 

###### 26 
To cause it to rain on the earth where no man is, _and_ in the wilderness where there is no man? 

###### 27 
To fulfill the wild and waste place, and to cause the bud of the herb to spring forth? 

###### 28 
Who is the father of the rain? or who hath begotten the drops of the dew? 

###### 29 
Out of whose womb came the ice? who hath engendered the frost of the heaven? 

###### 30 
The waters are hid as _with_ a stone: and the face of the depth is frozen. 

###### 31 
Canst thou restrain the sweet _influences_ of the Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion? 

###### 32 
Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in their time? canst thou also guide Arcturus with his sons? 

###### 33 
Knowest thou the course of heaven, or canst thou set the rule thereof in the earth? 

###### 34 
Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that the abundance of water may cover thee? 

###### 35 
Canst thou send the lightnings that they may walk, and say unto thee, Lo, here we are? 

###### 36 
Who hath put wisdom in the reins? or who hath given the heart understanding? 

###### 37 
Who can number clouds by wisdom? or who can cause to cease the bottles of heaven, 

###### 38 
When the earth groweth into hardness, and the clots are fast together?
