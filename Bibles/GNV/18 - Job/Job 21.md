###### 1 
But Job answered, and said, 

###### 2 
Hear diligently my words, and this shall be instead of your consolations. 

###### 3 
Suffer me that I may speak, and when I have spoken, mock on. 

###### 4 
Do I _direct_ my talk to man? If it were so, how should not my spirit be troubled? 

###### 5 
Mark me, and be abashed, and lay your hand upon _your_ mouth. 

###### 6 
Even when I remember, I am afraid, and fear taketh hold on my flesh. 

###### 7 
Wherefore do the wicked live, _and_ wax old, and grow in wealth? 

###### 8 
Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their generation before their eyes. 

###### 9 
Their houses are peaceable without fear, and the rod of God is not upon them. 

###### 10 
Their bullock gendereth, and faileth not: their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf. 

###### 11 
They send forth their children like sheep, and their sons dance. 

###### 12 
They take the tambourine and harp, and rejoice in the sound of the organs. 

###### 13 
They spend their days in wealth, and suddenly they go down to the grave. 

###### 14 
They say also unto God, Depart from us: for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways. 

###### 15 
Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we should pray unto him? 

###### 16 
Lo, their wealth is not in their hand: _therefore_ let the counsel of the wicked be far from me. 

###### 17 
How oft shall the candle of the wicked be put out and their destruction come upon them? he will divide _their_ lives in his wrath. 

###### 18 
They shall be as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away. 

###### 19 
God will lay up the sorrow _of the father_ for his children: when he rewardeth him, he shall know it. 

###### 20 
His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty. 

###### 21 
For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off? 

###### 22 
Shall any teach God knowledge, who judgeth the highest things? 

###### 23 
One dieth in his full strength, being in all ease and prosperity. 

###### 24 
His breasts are full of milk, and his bones run full of marrow. 

###### 25 
And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure. 

###### 26 
They shall sleep both in the dust, and the worms shall cover them. 

###### 27 
Behold, I know your thoughts, and the enterprises _wherewith_ ye do me wrong. 

###### 28 
For ye say, Where is the prince's house? and where is the tabernacle of the wicked's dwelling? 

###### 29 
May ye not ask them that go by the way? and ye cannot deny their signs. 

###### 30 
But the wicked is kept unto the day of destruction, _and_ they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath. 

###### 31 
Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall reward him for that he hath done? 

###### 32 
Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and remain in the heap. 

###### 33 
The slimy valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as before him there were innumerable. 

###### 34 
How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answer there remain but lies?
