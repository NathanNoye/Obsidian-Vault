###### 1 
I made a covenant with mine eyes: why then should I think on a maid? 

###### 2 
For what portion _should I have _of God from above? and _what_ inheritance of the almighty from on high? 

###### 3 
Is not destruction to the wicked, and strange _punishment_ to the workers of iniquity? 

###### 4 
Doth not he behold my ways, and tell all my steps? 

###### 5 
If I have walked in vanity, or if my foot hath made haste to deceit? 

###### 6 
Let God weigh me in the just balance, and he shall know my uprightness. 

###### 7 
If my step hath turned out of the way, or mine heart hath walked after mine eye, or if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands, 

###### 8 
Let me sow, and let another eat: yea, let my plants be rooted out. 

###### 9 
If mine heart hath been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at the door of my neighbor, 

###### 10 
Let my wife grind unto another man, and let other men bow down upon her. 

###### 11 
For this is a wickedness, and iniquity to be condemned. 

###### 12 
Yea, this is a fire that shall devour to destruction, and which shall root out all my increase. 

###### 13 
If I did contemn the judgment of my servant, and of my maid, when they did contend with me, 

###### 14 
What then shall I do when God standeth up? and when he shall visit _me_, what shall I answer? 

###### 15 
He that hath made me in the womb, hath he not made him? hath not he alone fashioned us in the womb? 

###### 16 
If I restrained the poor of _their_ desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, 

###### 17 
Or have eaten my morsels alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof, 

###### 18 
(For from my youth hath he grown up with me as_ with_ a father, and from my mother's womb have I been a guide unto her.) 

###### 19 
If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering, 

###### 20 
If his loins have not blessed me, because he was warmed with the fleece of my sheep, 

###### 21 
If I have lifted up mine hand against the fatherless, when I saw that I might help him in the gate, 

###### 22 
Let mine arm fall from my shoulder, and mine arm be broken from the bone. 

###### 23 
For God's punishment was fearful unto me, and I could not _be delivered_ from his Highness. 

###### 24 
If I made gold mine hope, or have said to the wedge of gold, _Thou_ art my confidence, 

###### 25 
If I rejoiced because my substance was great, or because mine hand had gotten much, 

###### 26 
If I did behold the sun, when it shined, or the moon walking in _her_ brightness, 

###### 27 
If mine heart did flatter me in secret, or if my mouth did kiss mine hand, 

###### 28 
(This also had been an iniquity to be condemned: for I had denied the God above.) 

###### 29 
If I rejoiced at his destruction that hated me, or was moved _to joy_ when evil came upon him, 

###### 30 
Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse unto his soul. 

###### 31 
Did not the men of my Tabernacle say, Who shall give us of his flesh? we cannot be satisfied. 

###### 32 
The stranger did not lodge in the street, _but_ I opened my doors unto him, that went by the way. 

###### 33 
If I have hid my sins, as Adam, concealing mine iniquity in my bosom, 

###### 34 
Though I could have made afraid a great multitude, yet the most contemptible of the families did fear me: so I kept silence, and went not out of the door. 

###### 35 
Oh that I had some to hear me! behold my sign that the Almighty will witness for me: though mine adversary should write a book _against me_, 

###### 36 
Would not I take it upon my shoulder, _and_ bind it as a crown unto me? 

###### 37 
I will tell him the number of my goings, and go unto him as to a prince. 

###### 38 
If my land cry against me, or the furrows thereof complain together, 

###### 39 
If I have eaten the fruits thereof without silver: or _if_ I have grieved the souls of the masters thereof, 

###### 40 
Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle in the stead of barley. THE WORDS OF JOB ARE ENDED.
