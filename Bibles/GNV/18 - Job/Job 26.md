###### 1 
But Job answered, and said, 

###### 2 
Whom helpest thou? him that hath no power? savest thou the arm that hath no strength? 

###### 3 
Whom counselest thou? him that hath no wisdom? thou showest right well as the thing is. 

###### 4 
To whom dost thou declare _these_ words? or whose spirit cometh out of thee? 

###### 5 
The dead things are formed under the waters, and near unto them. 

###### 6 
The grave is naked before him, and there is no covering for destruction. 

###### 7 
He stretcheth out the North over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. 

###### 8 
He bindeth the waters in his clouds, and the cloud is not broken under them. 

###### 9 
He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it. 

###### 10 
He hath set bounds about the waters, until the day and night come to an end. 

###### 11 
The pillars of heaven tremble and quake at his reproof. 

###### 12 
The sea is calm by his power, and by his understanding he smiteth the pride _thereof_. 

###### 13 
His Spirit hath garnished the heavens, _and_ his hand hath formed the crooked serpent. 

###### 14 
Lo, these are part of his ways: but how little a portion hear we of him? and who can understand his fearful power?
