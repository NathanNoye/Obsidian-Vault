###### 1 
Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 

###### 2 
Shall a wise man speak words of the wind? and fill his belly with the East wind? 

###### 3 
Shall he dispute with words not comely? or with talk that is not profitable? 

###### 4 
Surely thou hast cast off fear, and restrainest prayer before God: 

###### 5 
For thy mouth declareth thine iniquity, seeing thou hast chosen the tongue of the crafty. 

###### 6 
Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I, and thy lips testify against thee. 

###### 7 
Art thou the first man that was born? and wast thou made before the hills? 

###### 8 
Hast thou heard the secret counsel of God, and dost thou restrain wisdom to thee? 

###### 9 
What knowest thou that we know not? _and_ understandest that is not in us? 

###### 10 
With us are both ancient and very aged men, far older than thy father. 

###### 11 
_Seem_ the consolations of God small unto thee? is this thing strange unto thee? 

###### 12 
Why doth thine heart take thee away, and what do thine eyes mean, 

###### 13 
That thou answerest to God at thy pleasure, and bringest _such_ words out of thy mouth? 

###### 14 
What is man, that he should be clean? and he that is born of woman, that he should be just? 

###### 15 
Behold, he found no steadfastness in his Saints: yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight. 

###### 16 
How much more _is_ man abominable, and filthy, which drinketh iniquity like water? 

###### 17 
I will tell thee: hear me, and I will declare that which I have seen: 

###### 18 
Which wise men have told, _as they have heard_ of their fathers, and have not kept it secret: 

###### 19 
To whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed through them. 

###### 20 
The wicked man is continually as one that travaileth of child, and the number of years is hid from the tyrant. 

###### 21 
A sound of fear _is_ in his ears, _and_ in his prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him. 

###### 22 
He believeth not to return out of darkness: for he seeth the sword before him. 

###### 23 
He wandereth to and fro for bread where _he may_: he knoweth that the day of darkness is prepared at hand. 

###### 24 
Affliction and anguish shall make him afraid: they shall prevail against him as a king ready to the battle. 

###### 25 
For he hath stretched out his hand against God, and made himself strong against the Almighty. 

###### 26 
_Therefore God_ shall run upon him, _even_ upon his neck, and against the most thick part of his shield. 

###### 27 
Because he hath covered his face with his fatness, and hath collops in _his_ flank. 

###### 28 
Though he dwell in desolate cities, _and_ in houses which no man inhabiteth, but are become heaps, 

###### 29 
He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof in the earth. 

###### 30 
He shall never depart out of darkness: the flame shall dry up his branches, and he shall go away with the breath of his mouth. 

###### 31 
He believeth not that he erreth in vanity: therefore vanity shall be his change. 

###### 32 
His branch shall not be green, but shall be cut off before his day. 

###### 33 
_God_ shall destroy him as the vine her sour grape, and shall cast him off, as the olive _doth_ her flower. 

###### 34 
For the congregation of the hypocrite shall be desolate, and fire shall devour the houses of bribes. 

###### 35 
_For_ they conceive mischief and bring forth vanity, and their belly hath prepared deceit.
