###### 1 
Call now, if any will answer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn? 

###### 2 
Doubtless anger killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the idiot. 

###### 3 
I have seen the foolish well rooted, and suddenly I cursed his habitation, _saying_, 

###### 4 
His children shall be far from salvation, and they shall be destroyed in the gate, and none shall deliver them. 

###### 5 
The hungry shall eat up his harvest: yea, they shall take it from among the thorns, and the thirsty shall drink up their substance. 

###### 6 
For misery cometh not forth of the dust, neither doeth affliction spring out of the earth. 

###### 7 
But man is born unto travail, as the sparks fly upward. 

###### 8 
But I would inquire at God, and turn my talk unto God: 

###### 9 
Which doeth great things, and unsearchable, _and_ marvelous things without number. 

###### 10 
He giveth rain upon the earth, and poureth water upon the streets, 

###### 11 
And setteth up on high them that be low, that the sorrowful may be exalted to salvation. 

###### 12 
He scattereth the devices of the crafty: so that their hands cannot accomplish that which they do enterprise. 

###### 13 
He taketh the wise in their craftiness, and the counsel of the wicked is made foolish. 

###### 14 
They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday, as in the night. 

###### 15 
But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the violent man, 

###### 16 
So that the poor hath _his_ hope, but iniquity shall stop her mouth. 

###### 17 
Behold, blessed _is_ the man whom God correcteth: therefore refuse not thou the chastising of the Almighty. 

###### 18 
For he maketh the wound, and bindeth it up: he smiteth, and his hands make whole. 

###### 19 
He shall deliver thee in six troubles, and in the seventh the evil shall not touch thee. 

###### 20 
In famine he shall deliver thee from death: and in battle from the power of the sword. 

###### 21 
Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue, and thou shalt not be afraid of destruction when it cometh. 

###### 22 
_But_ thou shalt laugh at destruction and dearth, and shalt not be afraid of the beast of the earth. 

###### 23 
For the stones of the field shall be in league with thee, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee. 

###### 24 
And thou shalt know, that peace _shall be_ in thy tabernacle, and thou shalt visit thine habitation, and shalt not sin. 

###### 25 
Thou shalt perceive also that thy seed _shall be_ great, and thy posterity as the grass of the earth. 

###### 26 
Thou shalt go to thy grave in a full age, as a rick _of corn_ cometh in due season _into the barn. _ 

###### 27 
Lo, thus have we inquired of it, _and_ so it is: hear this and know it for thyself.
