###### 1 
So Job proceeded, and continued his parable, saying, 

###### 2 
Oh that I were as in times past, when God preserved me! 

###### 3 
When his light shined upon mine head: _and when_ by his light I walked through the darkness, 

###### 4 
As I was in the days of my youth: when God's providence _was_ upon my tabernacle: 

###### 5 
When the Almighty was yet with me, _and_ my children round about me: 

###### 6 
when I washed my paths with butter, and when the rock poured me out rivers of oil: 

###### 7 
When I went out to the gate, _even_ to the judgment seat, _and when_ I caused them to prepare my seat in the street. 

###### 8 
The young men saw me, and hid themselves, and the aged arose, _and_ stood up. 

###### 9 
The princes stayed talk, and laid their hand on their mouth. 

###### 10 
The voice of princes was hid, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth. 

###### 11 
And when the ear heard me, it blessed me, and when the eye saw _me_, it gave witness to me. 

###### 12 
For I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him. 

###### 13 
The blessing of him that was ready to perish, came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to rejoice. 

###### 14 
I put on justice, and it covered me: my judgment _was_ as a robe, and a crown. 

###### 15 
I was the eyes to the blind, and I was the feet to the lame. 

###### 16 
I was a father unto the poor, and _when_ I knew not the cause, I sought it out diligently. 

###### 17 
I brake also the jaws of the unrighteous man, and plucked the prey out of his teeth. 

###### 18 
Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply _my_ days as the sand. 

###### 19 
_For _my root is spread out by the water, and the dew shall lie upon my branch. 

###### 20 
My glory shall renew toward me, and my bow shall be restored in mine hand. 

###### 21 
Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and held their tongue at my counsel. 

###### 22 
After my words they replied not, and my talk dropped upon them. 

###### 23 
And they waited for me, as for the rain, and they opened their mouth as for the latter rain. 

###### 24 
_If_ I laughed on them, they believed it not: neither did they cause the light of my countenance to fall. 

###### 25 
I appointed out their way, and did sit as chief, and dwelt as a King in the army, _and_ like him that comforteth the mourners.
