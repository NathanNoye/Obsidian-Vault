###### 1 
Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my talk, and hearken unto all my words. 

###### 2 
Behold now, I have opened my mouth: my tongue hath spoken in my mouth. 

###### 3 
My words _are_ in the uprightness of mine heart, and my lips shall speak pure knowledge. 

###### 4 
The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life. 

###### 5 
If thou canst give me answer, prepare thyself _and_ stand before me. 

###### 6 
Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I am also formed of the clay. 

###### 7 
Behold, my terror shall not fear thee, neither shall mine hand be heavy upon thee. 

###### 8 
Doubtless thou hast spoken in mine ears, and I have heard the voice of _thy_ words. 

###### 9 
I am clean, without sin: I am innocent and there is none iniquity in me. 

###### 10 
Lo, he hath found occasions against me, and counted me for his enemy. 

###### 11 
He hath put my feet in the stocks, and looketh narrowly unto all my paths. 

###### 12 
Behold, in this hast thou not done right: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man. 

###### 13 
Why dost thou strive against him? for he doth not give account of all his matters. 

###### 14 
For God speaketh once or twice, and one seeth it not. 

###### 15 
In dreams _and_ visions of the night, when sleep falleth upon men, and they sleep upon _their_ beds, 

###### 16 
Then he openeth the ears of men, even by their corrections, _which_ he had sealed, 

###### 17 
That he might cause man to turn away from _his_ enterprise, and that he might hide the pride of man, 

###### 18 
And keep back his soul from the pit, and that his life should not pass by the sword. 

###### 19 
He is also stricken with sorrow upon his bed, and the grief of his bones _is_ sore, 

###### 20 
So that his life causeth him to abhor bread, and his soul dainty meat. 

###### 21 
His flesh faileth that it cannot be seen, and his bones _which _were not seen, clatter. 

###### 22 
So his soul draweth to the grave, and his life to the buriers. 

###### 23 
If there be a messenger with him, _or_ an interpreter, one of a thousand to declare unto man his righteousness, 

###### 24 
Then will he have mercy upon him, and will say, Deliver him, that he go not down into the pit: for I have received a reconciliation. 

###### 25 
_Then_ shall his flesh be as fresh as a child's, _and_ shall return as in the days of his youth. 

###### 26 
He shall pray unto God, and he will be favorable unto him, and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness. 

###### 27 
He looketh upon men, and if one say, I have sinned, and perverted righteousness, and it did not profit me, 

###### 28 
He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light. 

###### 29 
Lo, all these things will God work twice or thrice with a man, 

###### 30 
That he may turn back his soul from the pit, to be illuminated in the light of the living. 

###### 31 
Mark well, O Job, _and_ hear me: keep silence and I will speak. 

###### 32 
If there be matter, answer me, _and_ speak: for I desire to justify thee. 

###### 33 
If thou hast not, hear me: hold thy tongue, and I will teach thee wisdom.
