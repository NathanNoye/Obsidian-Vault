###### 1 
Then Job answered, and said, 

###### 2 
Indeed because that ye are the people _only_, wisdom must die with you. 

###### 3 
But I have understanding as well as you, and am not inferior unto you: yea, who knoweth not such things? 

###### 4 
I am as one mocked of his neighbor, who calleth upon God, and he heareth him: the just _and_ the upright is laughed to scorn. 

###### 5 
He that is ready to fall, _is as_ a lamp despised in the opinion of the rich. 

###### 6 
The tabernacles of robbers do prosper, and they are in safety, that provoke God, whom God hath enriched with his hand. 

###### 7 
Ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee, and the fowls of the heaven, and they shall tell thee: 

###### 8 
Or speak to the earth, and it shall show thee: or the fishes of the sea, and they shall declare unto thee. 

###### 9 
Who is ignorant of all these, but that the hand of the Lord hath made these? 

###### 10 
In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind. 

###### 11 
Doth not the ears discern the words, and the mouth taste meat for itself? 

###### 12 
Among the ancient _is_ wisdom, and in the length of days _is_ understanding. 

###### 13 
With him _is_ wisdom and strength: he hath counsel and understanding. 

###### 14 
Behold, he will break down, and it cannot be built: he shutteth a man up, and he cannot be loosed. 

###### 15 
Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: but when he sendeth them out, they destroy the earth. 

###### 16 
With him _is_ strength and wisdom: he that is deceived, and that deceiveth, are his. 

###### 17 
He causeth the counselors to go _as_ spoiled, and maketh the judges fools. 

###### 18 
He looseth the collar of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. 

###### 19 
He leadeth away the princes _as_ a prey, and overthroweth the mighty. 

###### 20 
He taketh away the speech from the faithful _counselors_, and taketh away the judgment of the ancient. 

###### 21 
He poureth contempt upon princes, and maketh the strength of the mighty weak. 

###### 22 
He discovereth the deep places from _their_ darkness, and bringeth forth the shadow of death to light. 

###### 23 
He increaseth the people, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and bringeth them in again. 

###### 24 
He taketh away the hearts of them that are the chief over the people of the earth, and maketh them to wander in the wilderness out of the way. 

###### 25 
They grope in the dark without light: and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
