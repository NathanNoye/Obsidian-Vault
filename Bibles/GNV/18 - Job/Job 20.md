###### 1 
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

###### 2 
Doubtless my thoughts cause me to answer, and therefore I make haste. 

###### 3 
I have heard the correction of my reproach: therefore the spirit of mine understanding causeth me to answer. 

###### 4 
Knowest thou not this of old? _and_ since _God_ placed man upon the earth, 

###### 5 
That the rejoicing of the wicked _is_ short, and that the joy of the hypocrites is but a moment? 

###### 6 
Though his excellency mount up to the heaven, and his head reach unto the clouds, 

###### 7 
_Yet_ shall he perish forever like his dung, _and_ they which have seen him, shall say, Where is he? 

###### 8 
He shall flee away as a dream, and they shall not find him, and shall pass away as a vision of the night. 

###### 9 
So that the eye which had seen him, shall do so no more, and his place shall see him no more. 

###### 10 
His children shall flatter the poor, and his hands shall restore his substance. 

###### 11 
His bones are full _of the sin_ of his youth, and it shall lie down with him in the dust. 

###### 12 
When wickedness was sweet in his mouth, _and_ he hid it under his tongue, 

###### 13 
_And_ favored it, and would not forsake it, but kept it close in his mouth, 

###### 14 
_Then_ his meat in his bowels was turned: the gall of Asps _was_ in the midst of him. 

###### 15 
He hath devoured substance, and he shall vomit it: _for_ God shall draw it out of his belly. 

###### 16 
He shall suck the gall of Asps, _and_ the viper's tongue shall slay him. 

###### 17 
He shall not see the rivers, _nor_ the floods _and_ streams of honey and butter. 

###### 18 
He shall restore the labor, and shall devour no more: _even_ according to the substance _shall be _his exchange, and he shall enjoy it no more. 

###### 19 
For he hath undone _many_: he hath forsaken the poor, _and_ hath spoiled houses which he built not. 

###### 20 
Surely he shall feel no quietness in his body, _neither_ shall he reserve of that which he desired. 

###### 21 
There shall none of his meat be left: therefore none shall hope for his goods. 

###### 22 
When he shall be filled with his abundance, he shall be in pain, _and_ the hand of all the wicked shall assail him. 

###### 23 
He shall be about to fill his belly, _but God_ shall send upon him his fierce wrath, and shall cause to rain upon him, _even_ upon his meat. 

###### 24 
He shall flee from the iron weapons, _and_ the bow of steel shall strike him through. 

###### 25 
_The arrow_ is drawn out, and cometh forth of the body, and shineth of his gall, _so_ fear cometh upon him. 

###### 26 
All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: the fire that is not blown shall devour him, _and_ that which remaineth in his tabernacle shall be destroyed. 

###### 27 
The heaven shall declare his wickedness, and the earth shall rise up against him. 

###### 28 
The increase of his house shall go away: it shall flow away in the day of his wrath. 

###### 29 
This is the portion of the wicked man from God, and the heritage _that he shall have_ of God, for his words.
