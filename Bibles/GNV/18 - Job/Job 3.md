###### 1 
Afterward Job opened his mouth, and cursed his day. 

###### 2 
And Job cried out, and said, 

###### 3 
Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night when it was said, There is a man child conceived. 

###### 4 
Let that day be darkness, let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it, 

###### 5 
_But_ let darkness and the shadow of death stain it: let the cloud remain upon it, and let them make it fearful as a bitter day. 

###### 6 
Let darkness possess that night, let it not be joined unto the days of the year, nor let it come into the count of the months. 

###### 7 
Yea, desolate be that night, and let no joy be in it. 

###### 8 
Let them that curse the day, (being ready to renew their mourning) curse it. 

###### 9 
Let the stars of that twilight be dim through darkness of it: let it look for light, but have none: neither let it see the dawning of the day, 

###### 10 
Because it shut not up the doors of my _mother's_ womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. 

###### 11 
Why died I not in the birth? or why died I not, when I came out of the womb? 

###### 12 
Why did the knees prevent me? and why did I suck the breasts? 

###### 13 
For _so_ should I now have lain and been quiet, I should have slept then, _and_ been at rest, 

###### 14 
With the kings and counselors of the earth, which have built themselves desolate places: 

###### 15 
Or with the princes that had gold, _and_ have filled their houses with silver. 

###### 16 
Or _why_ was I not hid, as an untimely birth, _either_ as infants, _which_ have not seen the light? 

###### 17 
The wicked have there ceased from _their_ tyranny, and there they that labored valiantly, are at rest. 

###### 18 
The prisoners rest together, _and_ hear not the voice of the oppressor. 

###### 19 
There are small and great, and the servant _is_ free from his master. 

###### 20 
Wherefore is the light given to him that is in misery? and life unto them that have heavy hearts? 

###### 21 
Which long for death, and if it come not, they would even search it more than treasures: 

###### 22 
Which joy for gladness, _and_ rejoice, when they can find the grave. 

###### 23 
_Why is the light given_ to the man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in? 

###### 24 
For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the water. 

###### 25 
For the thing I feared, is come upon me, and the thing that I was afraid of, is come unto me. 

###### 26 
I had no peace, neither had I quietness, neither had I rest, yet trouble is come.
