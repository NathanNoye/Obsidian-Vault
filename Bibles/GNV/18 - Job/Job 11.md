###### 1 
Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 

###### 2 
Should not the multitude of words be answered? or should a great talker be justified? 

###### 3 
Should men hold their peace at thy lies? and when thou mockest _others_, shall none make thee ashamed? 

###### 4 
For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes. 

###### 5 
But, oh that God would speak and open his lips against thee! 

###### 6 
That he might show thee the secrets of wisdom how thou hast _deserved_ double, according to right: know therefore that God hath forgotten thee for thine iniquity. 

###### 7 
Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty to _his_ perfection? 

###### 8 
The heavens are high, what canst thou do? it is deeper than the hell, how canst thou know it? 

###### 9 
The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and it is broader than the Sea. 

###### 10 
If he cut off and shut up, or gather together, who can turn him back? 

###### 11 
For he knoweth vain men, and seeth iniquity, and him that understandeth nothing. 

###### 12 
Yet vain man would be wise, though man _new_born is like a wild ass colt. 

###### 13 
If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him: 

###### 14 
If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let no wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacle. 

###### 15 
Then truly shalt thou lift up thy face without spot, and shalt be stable, and shalt not fear. 

###### 16 
But thou shalt forget _thy_ misery, and remember it as waters that are past. 

###### 17 
Thine age also shall appear more _clear_ than the noon day: thou shalt shine _and_ be as the morning. 

###### 18 
And thou shalt be bold, because there is hope: and thou shalt dig pits, _and_ shalt lie down safely. 

###### 19 
For when thou takest thy rest, none shall make thee afraid: yea, many shall make suit unto thee. 

###### 20 
But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and their refuge shall perish, and their hope _shall be _sorrow of mind.
