###### 1 
But Job answered, and said, 

###### 2 
How long will ye vex my soul, and torment me with words? 

###### 3 
Ye have now ten times reproached me, and are not ashamed: ye are impudent toward me. 

###### 4 
And though I had indeed erred, mine error remaineth with me. 

###### 5 
But indeed if ye will advance yourselves against me, and rebuke me for my reproach, 

###### 6 
Know now, that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net. 

###### 7 
Behold, I cry out of violence, but I have none answer: I cry, but there _is_ no judgment. 

###### 8 
He hath hedged up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths. 

###### 9 
He hath spoiled me of mine honor, and taken the crown away from mine head. 

###### 10 
He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and he hath removed mine hope like a tree. 

###### 11 
And he hath kindled his wrath against me, and counteth me as one of his enemies. 

###### 12 
His armies came together, and made their way upon me, and camped about my tabernacle. 

###### 13 
He hath removed my brethren far from me, and also mine acquaintance were strangers unto me. 

###### 14 
My neighbors have forsaken me, and my familiars have forgotten me. 

###### 15 
They that dwell in mine house, and my maids took me for a stranger: for I was a stranger in their sight. 

###### 16 
I called my servant, but he would not answer, _though_ I prayed him with my mouth. 

###### 17 
My breath was strange unto my wife, though I prayed her for the children's sake of mine own body. 

###### 18 
The wicked also despised me, _and_ when I rose, they spake against me. 

###### 19 
All my secret friends abhorred me, and they whom I loved, are turned against me. 

###### 20 
My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth. 

###### 21 
Have pity upon me: have pity upon me, (O ye my friends) for the hand of God hath touched me. 

###### 22 
Why do ye persecute me, as God? and are not satisfied with my flesh? 

###### 23 
Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were written even in a book, 

###### 24 
_And_ graven with an iron pen in lead, or in stone forever! 

###### 25 
For I am sure that my Redeemer liveth, and he shall stand the last on the earth. 

###### 26 
And though after my skin _worms_ destroy this _body_, yet shall I see God in my flesh. 

###### 27 
Whom I myself shall see, and mine eyes shall behold, and none other _for me, though_ my reins are consumed within me. 

###### 28 
But ye said, Why is he persecuted? And there was a deep matter in me. 

###### 29 
Be ye afraid of the sword: for the sword will be avenged of wickedness, that ye may know that there is a judgment.
