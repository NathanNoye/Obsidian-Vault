###### 1 
There was a man in the land of Uz called Job, and this man was an upright and just man, one that feared God, and eschewed evil. 

###### 2 
And he had seven sons, and three daughters. 

###### 3 
His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and his family was very great, so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East. 

###### 4 
And his sons went and banqueted in their houses, every one his day, and sent, and called their three sisters to eat and to drink with them. 

###### 5 
And when the days of their banqueting were gone about, Job sent, and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings _according_ to the number of them all. For Job thought, It may be that my sons have sinned, and blasphemed God in their hearts, thus did Job every day. 

###### 6 
¶ Now on a day when the children of God came and stood before the Lord, Satan came also among them. 

###### 7 
Then the Lord said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? And Satan answered the Lord, saying, From compassing the earth to and fro, and from walking in it. 

###### 8 
And the Lord said unto Satan, Hast thou not considered my servant Job, how none _is_ like him in the earth? an upright and just man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? 

###### 9 
Then Satan answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought? 

###### 10 
Hast thou not made an hedge about him and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land. 

###### 11 
But stretch out now thine hand and touch all that he hath, _to see_ if he will not blaspheme thee to thy face. 

###### 12 
Then the Lord said unto Satan, Lo, all that he hath _is_ in thine hand: only upon himself shalt thou not stretch out thine hand. So Satan departed from the presence of the Lord. 

###### 13 
¶ And on a day, when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, 

###### 14 
There came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding in their places, 

###### 15 
And the Sabeans came violently, and took them: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword: but I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

###### 16 
And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said, The fire of God is fallen from the heaven, and hath burnt up the sheep and the servants, and devoured them: but I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

###### 17 
And while he was yet speaking, another came, and said, The Chaldeans set on three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them, and have slain the servants with the edge of the sword: but I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

###### 18 
And while he was yet speaking, came another, and said, Thy sons, and thy daughters were eating, and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house, 

###### 19 
And behold, there came a great wind from beyond the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, which fell upon the children, and they are dead, and I only am escaped alone to tell thee. 

###### 20 
Then Job arose, and rent his garment, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 

###### 21 
And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the Lord hath given, and the Lord hath taken it: blessed be the Name of the Lord. 

###### 22 
In all this did not Job sin, nor charge God foolishly.
