###### 1 
Man that is born of woman, is of short continuance and full of trouble. 

###### 2 
He shooteth forth as a flower, and is cut down: he vanisheth also as a shadow, and continueth not. 

###### 3 
_And_ yet thou openest thine eyes upon such one, and causest me to enter into judgment with thee. 

###### 4 
Who can bring a clean thing out of filthiness? there is not one. 

###### 5 
Are not his days determined? the number of his months _are_ with thee: thou hast appointed his bound, which he cannot pass. 

###### 6 
Turn from him that he may cease until his desired day, as an hireling. 

###### 7 
For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will yet sprout, and the branches thereof will not cease. 

###### 8 
Though the root of it wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof be dead in the ground, 

###### 9 
_Yet_ by the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant. 

###### 10 
But man is sick, and dieth, and man perisheth, and where is he? 

###### 11 
_As_ the waters pass from the sea, and as the flood decayeth and drieth up, 

###### 12 
So man sleepeth and riseth not: _for_ he shall not wake again, nor be raised from his sleep till the heaven be no more. 

###### 13 
Oh that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, and keep me secret, until thy wrath were past, _and_ wouldest give me term, and remember me! 

###### 14 
If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of mine appointed time will I wait, till my changing shall come. 

###### 15 
Thou shalt call me, and I will answer thee: thou lovest the work of thine own hands. 

###### 16 
But now thou numberest my steps, _and_ doest not delay my sins. 

###### 17 
Mine iniquity is sealed up, _as_ in a bag, and thou addest unto my wickedness. 

###### 18 
And surely _as_ the mountain that falleth, cometh to nought, and the rock that is removed from his place: 

###### 19 
_As_ the water breaketh the stones, _when_ thou overflowest the things which grow in the dust of the earth: so thou destroyest the hope of man. 

###### 20 
Thou prevailest always against him, so that he passeth away: he changeth his face when thou castest him away. 

###### 21 
And he knoweth not if his sons shall be honorable, neither shall he understand concerning them, whether they shall be of low degree, 

###### 22 
But _while_ his flesh _is_ upon him, he shall be sorrowful, and _while_ his soul _is_ in him, it shall mourn.
