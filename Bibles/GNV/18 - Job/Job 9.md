###### 1 
Then Job answered, and said, 

###### 2 
I know verily that it is so: for how should man _compared_ unto God, be justified? 

###### 3 
If he would dispute with him, he could not answer him one thing of thousand. 

###### 4 
He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath been fierce against him, and hath prospered? 

###### 5 
He removeth the mountains, and they feel not when he overthroweth them in his wrath. 

###### 6 
He removeth the earth out of her place, that the pillars thereof do shake. 

###### 7 
He commandeth the Sun, and it riseth not: he closeth up the stars, as under a signet. 

###### 8 
He himself alone spreadeth out the heavens, and walketh upon the height of the Sea. 

###### 9 
He maketh _the stars_ Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the climates of the South. 

###### 10 
He doeth great things, and unsearchable: yea, marvelous things without number. 

###### 11 
Lo, when he goeth by me, I see him not: and when he passeth by, I perceive him not: 

###### 12 
Behold, when he taketh a prey, who can make him to restore it? who shall say unto him, What doest thou? 

###### 13 
God will not withdraw his anger, _and_ the most mighty helpers do stoop under him. 

###### 14 
How much less shall I answer him? or how should I find out my words with him? 

###### 15 
For though I were just, yet could I not answer, _but_ I would make supplication to my Judge. 

###### 16 
If I cry, and he answer me, _yet_ would I not believe, that he heard my voice. 

###### 17 
For he destroyeth me with a tempest, and woundeth me without cause. 

###### 18 
He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness. 

###### 19 
If _we speak_ of strength, behold, he is strong: if _we speak_ of judgment, who shall bring me in to plead? 

###### 20 
If I should justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I would be perfect, he shall judge me wicked. 

###### 21 
_Though_ I were perfect, _yet_ I know not my soul: _therefore_ abhor I my life. 

###### 22 
This is one point: therefore I said, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked. 

###### 23 
If the scourge should suddenly slay, should _God_ laugh at the punishment of the innocent? 

###### 24 
The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof: if not, where is he? or who is he? 

###### 25 
My days have been more swift than a post: they have fled, and have seen no good thing. 

###### 26 
They are passed _as_ with the most swift ships, and as the Eagle that flieth to the prey. 

###### 27 
If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will cease from my wrath, and comfort me, 

###### 28 
_Then_ I am afraid of all my sorrows, knowing that thou wilt not judge me innocent. 

###### 29 
_If_ I be wicked, why labor I thus in vain? 

###### 30 
If I wash myself with snow water, and purge mine hands most clean, 

###### 31 
Yet shalt thou plunge me in the pit, and mine own clothes shall make me filthy. 

###### 32 
For he is not a man as I am, that I should answer him, _if_ we come together to judgment. 

###### 33 
Neither is there any umpire that might lay his hand upon us both. 

###### 34 
Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear astonish me: 

###### 35 
_Then_ will I speak, and fear him not: _but_ because I am not so, I hold me still.
