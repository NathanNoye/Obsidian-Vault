###### 1 
Elihu also proceeded and said, 

###### 2 
Suffer me a little and I will instruct thee: for _I have_ yet to speak on God's behalf. 

###### 3 
I will fetch my knowledge afar off, and will attribute righteousness unto my maker. 

###### 4 
For truly my words shall not be false, _and_ he that is perfect in knowledge, _speaketh_ with thee. 

###### 5 
Behold, the mighty God casteth away none that is mighty _and_ valiant of courage. 

###### 6 
He maintaineth not the wicked, but he giveth judgment to the afflicted. 

###### 7 
He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous, but _they are_ with kings in the throne, where he placeth them forever: thus they are exalted. 

###### 8 
And if they be bound in fetters _and_ tied with the cords of affliction, 

###### 9 
Then will he show them their work and their sins, because they have been proud. 

###### 10 
He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth them that they return from iniquity. 

###### 11 
If they obey and serve him, they shall end their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures: 

###### 12 
But if they will not obey, they shall pass by the sword and perish without knowledge. 

###### 13 
But the hypocrites of heart increase the wrath: _for_ they call not when he bindeth them. 

###### 14 
Their soul dieth in youth, and their life among the whoremongers. 

###### 15 
He delivereth the poor in his afflictions, and openeth their ear in trouble. 

###### 16 
Even so would he have taken thee out of the straight place _into_ a broad place, and not shut up beneath: and that which resteth upon thy table had been full of fat. 

###### 17 
But thou art full of the judgment of the wicked, _though_ judgment and equity maintain _all things_. 

###### 18 
For _God's_ wrath is, lest he should take thee away in _thine_ abundance: for no multitude of gifts can deliver thee. 

###### 19 
Will he regard thy riches? _he regardeth_ not gold, nor all them that excel in strength. 

###### 20 
Be not careful in the night, how he destroyeth the people out of their place. 

###### 21 
Take thou heed: look not to iniquity: for thou hast chosen it rather than affliction. 

###### 22 
Behold, God exalteth by his power: what teacher is like him? 

###### 23 
Who hath appointed to him his way? or who can say, Thou hast done wickedly? 

###### 24 
Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold. 

###### 25 
All men see it, and men behold it afar off. 

###### 26 
Behold, God _is_ excellent, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out. 

###### 27 
When he restraineth the drops of water, the rain poureth down by the vapor thereof, 

###### 28 
Which rain the clouds do drop _and_ let fall abundantly upon man. 

###### 29 
Who can know the divisions of the clouds, _and_ the thunders of his Tabernacle? 

###### 30 
Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea. 

###### 31 
For thereby he judgeth the people, and giveth meat abundantly. 

###### 32 
He covereth the light with the clouds, and commanded them to go against it. 

###### 33 
His companion showeth him therefore, and there is anger in rising up.
