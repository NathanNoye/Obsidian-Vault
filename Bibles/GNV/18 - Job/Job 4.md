###### 1 
Then Eliphaz the Temanite, answered and said, 

###### 2 
If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking? 

###### 3 
Behold, thou hast taught many, and hast strengthened the weary hands. 

###### 4 
Thy words have confirmed him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the weak knees. 

###### 5 
But now it is come upon thee, and thou art grieved: it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled. 

###### 6 
Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy patience, and uprightness of thy ways? 

###### 7 
Remember, I pray thee: who _ever_ perished, being an innocent? or where were the upright destroyed? 

###### 8 
As I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same. 

###### 9 
With the blast of God they perish, and with the breath of his nostrils are they consumed. 

###### 10 
The roaring of the Lion, and the voice of the Lioness, and the teeth of the Lion's whelps are broken. 

###### 11 
The Lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the Lion's whelps are scattered abroad. 

###### 12 
But a thing was brought to me secretly, and mine ear hath received a little thereof. 

###### 13 
In the thoughts of the visions of the night, when sleep falleth on men, 

###### 14 
Fear came upon me, and dread which made all my bones to tremble. 

###### 15 
And the wind passed before me, and made the hairs of my flesh to stand up. 

###### 16 
_Then_ stood _one_, and I knew not his face: an image _was_ before mine eyes, _and_ in silence heard I a voice, _saying_, 

###### 17 
Shall man be more just than God? or shall a man be more pure than his Maker? 

###### 18 
Behold, he found no steadfastness in his servants, and laid folly upon his Angels. 

###### 19 
How much more in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which shall be destroyed before the moth? 

###### 20 
They be destroyed from the morning unto the evening: they perish forever, without regard. 

###### 21 
Doth not their dignity go away with them? do they not die, and that without wisdom?
