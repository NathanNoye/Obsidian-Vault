###### 1 
My soul is cut off though I live: I will leave my complaint upon myself, _and_ will speak in the bitterness of my soul. 

###### 2 
I will say unto God, Condemn me not: show me, wherefore thou contendest with me. 

###### 3 
Thinkest thou it good to oppress me, _and_ to cast off the labor of thine hands, and to favor the counsel of the wicked? 

###### 4 
Hast thou carnal eyes? or dost thou see as man seeth? 

###### 5 
Are thy days as man's days? or thy years as the time of man, 

###### 6 
That thou inquirest of mine iniquity, and searchest out my sin? 

###### 7 
Thou knowest that I cannot do wickedly: for none can deliver me out of thine hand. 

###### 8 
Thine hands have made me, and fashioned me wholly round about, and wilt thou destroy me? 

###### 9 
Remember, I pray thee, that thou hast made me as the clay, and wilt thou bring me into dust again? 

###### 10 
Hast thou not poured me out as milk? and turned me to curds like cheese? 

###### 11 
Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and joined me together with bones and sinews. 

###### 12 
Thou hast given me life, and grace: and the visitation hath preserved my spirit. 

###### 13 
Though thou hast hid these things in thine heart, _yet_ I know that it is so with thee. 

###### 14 
If I have sinned, then thou wilt straightly look unto me, and wilt not hold me guiltless of mine iniquity. 

###### 15 
If I have done wickedly, woe unto me: if I have done righteously, I will not lift up mine head, being full of confusion, because I see mine affliction. 

###### 16 
But let it increase: hunt thou me as a lion: return and show thyself marvelous upon me. 

###### 17 
Thou renewest thy plagues against me, and thou increasest thy wrath against me: changes and armies _of sorrows_ are against me. 

###### 18 
Wherefore then hast thou brought me out of the womb? Oh that I had perished, and that none eye had seen me! 

###### 19 
_And_ that I were as I had not been, _but_ brought from the womb to the grave! 

###### 20 
Are not my days few? let him cease, _and_ leave off from me, that I may take a little comfort, 

###### 21 
Before I go and shall not return, _even_ to the land of darkness and shadow of death: 

###### 22 
Into a land, I _say_, dark as darkness itself, _and_ into the shadow of death, where is none order, but the light _is there_ as darkness.
