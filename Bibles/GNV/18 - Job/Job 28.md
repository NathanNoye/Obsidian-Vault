###### 1 
The silver surely hath his vein, and the gold his palace, _where_ they take it. 

###### 2 
Iron is taken out of the dust, and brass is molten out of the stone. 

###### 3 
_God_ putteth an end to darkness, and he trieth the perfection of all things: he setteth a bond of darkness, and of the shadow of death. 

###### 4 
The flood breaketh out against the inhabitant, _and the waters_ forgotten of the foot, being higher than man, are gone away. 

###### 5 
Out of the same earth cometh bread, and under it, as it were fire is turned up. 

###### 6 
The stones thereof _are_ a place of Sapphires, and the dust of it _is_ gold. 

###### 7 
There is a path which no fowl hath known, neither hath the kite's eye seen it. 

###### 8 
The Lion's whelps have not walked it, nor the Lion passed thereby. 

###### 9 
He putteth his hand upon the rocks, and overthroweth the mountains by the roots. 

###### 10 
He breaketh rivers in the roots, and his eye seeth every precious thing. 

###### 11 
He bindeth the floods, that they do not overflow, and the thing that is hid, bringeth he to light. 

###### 12 
But where is wisdom found? and where is the place of understanding? 

###### 13 
Man knoweth not the price thereof: for it is not found in the land of the living. 

###### 14 
The depth saith, It is not in me: the Sea also saith, It is not with me. 

###### 15 
Gold shall not be given for it, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof. 

###### 16 
It shall not be valued with the wedge of gold of Ophir, _nor_ with the precious onyx, nor the sapphire. 

###### 17 
The gold nor the crystal shall be equal unto it, nor the exchange _shall be_ for plate of fine gold. 

###### 18 
No mention shall be made of coral, nor of the gabish: for wisdom is more precious than pearls. 

###### 19 
The Topaz of Ethiopia shall not be equal unto it, neither shall it be valued with the wedge of pure gold. 

###### 20 
Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding, 

###### 21 
Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all the living, and is hid from the fowls of the heaven? 

###### 22 
Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears. 

###### 23 
_But_ God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof. 

###### 24 
For he beholdeth the ends of the world, _and_ seeth all that is under heaven, 

###### 25 
To make the weight of the winds and to weigh the waters by measure. 

###### 26 
When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunders, 

###### 27 
Then did he see it, and counted it: he prepared it, and also considered it. 

###### 28 
And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to depart from evil _is_ understanding.
