###### 1 
Moreover Elihu answered and said, 

###### 2 
Hear my words, ye wise men, and hearken unto me ye that have knowledge. 

###### 3 
For the ear trieth the words, as the mouth tasteth meat. 

###### 4 
Let us seek judgment among us, and let us know among ourselves what is good. 

###### 5 
For Job hath said, I am righteous, and God hath taken away my judgment. 

###### 6 
Should I lie in my right? my _wound_ of the arrow is grievous without _my_ sin. 

###### 7 
What man is like Job, that drinketh scornfulness like water? 

###### 8 
Which goeth in the company of them that work iniquity, and walketh with wicked men? 

###### 9 
For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should walk with God. 

###### 10 
Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of wisdom, God forbid that wickedness _should be_ in God, and iniquity in the Almighty. 

###### 11 
For he will render unto man _according _to his work, and cause everyone to find according to his way. 

###### 12 
And certainly God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment. 

###### 13 
Whom hath he appointed over the earth besides himself? or who hath placed the whole world? 

###### 14 
If he set his heart upon _man_, and gather unto himself his spirit and his breath, 

###### 15 
All flesh shall perish together, and man shall return unto dust. 

###### 16 
And if thou hast understanding, hear this, _and_ hearken to the voice of my words. 

###### 17 
Shall he that hateth judgment, govern? and wilt thou judge him wicked that is most just? 

###### 18 
Wilt thou say unto a king, _Thou art_ wicked? or to princes, _Ye are_ ungodly? 

###### 19 
_How much less_ to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, and regardeth not the rich, more than the poor? for they be all the work of his hands. 

###### 20 
They shall die suddenly, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and they shall pass forth and take away the mighty without hand. 

###### 21 
For his eyes _are_ upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings. 

###### 22 
There is no darkness nor shadow of death, that the workers of iniquity might be hid therein. 

###### 23 
For he will not lay on man so much, that he should enter into judgment with God. 

###### 24 
He shall break the mighty without seeking, and shall set up others in their stead. 

###### 25 
Therefore shall he declare their works: he shall turn the night, and they shall be destroyed. 

###### 26 
He striketh them as wicked men in the places of the seers, 

###### 27 
Because they have turned back from him, and would not consider all his ways: 

###### 28 
So that they have caused the voice of the poor to come unto him, and he hath heard the cry of the afflicted. 

###### 29 
And when he giveth quietness, who can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who can behold him, whether _it be_ upon nations, or upon a man only? 

###### 30 
Because the hypocrite doth reign, _and_ because the people are snared. 

###### 31 
Surely _it appertaineth_ unto God to say, I have pardoned, I will not destroy. 

###### 32 
But if I see not, teach thou me: if I have done wickedly, I will do no more. 

###### 33 
Will he perform the thing through thee? for thou hast reproved it, because that thou hast chosen, and not I: now speak what thou knowest. 

###### 34 
Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me. 

###### 35 
Job hath not spoken of knowledge, neither were his words according to wisdom. 

###### 36 
I desire that Job may be tried, unto the end, touching the answers for wicked men. 

###### 37 
For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
