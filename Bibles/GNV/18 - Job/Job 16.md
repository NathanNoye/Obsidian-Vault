###### 1 
But Job answered and said, 

###### 2 
I have oftentimes heard such things: miserable comforters are ye all. 

###### 3 
Shall there be none end of words of wind? or what maketh thee bold so to answer? 

###### 4 
I could also speak as ye do: (but would God your soul were in my soul's stead) I could keep you company in speaking, and could shake mine head at you, 

###### 5 
But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the comfort of my lips should assuage _your sorrow_. 

###### 6 
Though I speak, my sorrow cannot be assuaged: though I cease, what release have I? 

###### 7 
But now he maketh me weary: O _God_, thou hast made all my congregation desolate, 

###### 8 
And hast made me full of wrinkles which is a witness thereof, and my leanness riseth up in me, testifying _the same_ in my face. 

###### 9 
His wrath hath torn _me_, and he hateth me, _and_ gnasheth upon me with his teeth: mine enemy hath sharpened his eyes against me. 

###### 10 
They have opened their mouths upon me, and smitten me on the cheek in reproach: they gathered themselves together against me. 

###### 11 
God hath delivered me to the unjust, and hath made me to turn out of the way by the hands of the wicked. 

###### 12 
I was in wealth, but he hath brought me to nought: he hath taken me by the neck and beaten me, and set me as a mark for himself. 

###### 13 
His archers compass me round about: he cutteth my reins, and doth not spare, and poureth my gall upon the ground. 

###### 14 
He hath broken me with one breaking upon another, and runneth upon me like a giant. 

###### 15 
I have sowed a sackcloth upon my skin, and have abased mine horn unto the dust. 

###### 16 
My face is withered with weeping, and the shadow of death _is_ upon mine eyes, 

###### 17 
Though _there be_ no wickedness in mine hands, and my prayer _be_ pure. 

###### 18 
O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my crying find no place. 

###### 19 
For lo, now my witness _is_ in the heaven, and my record _is_ on high. 

###### 20 
My friends speak eloquently against me: _but_ mine eye poureth out _tears_ unto God. 

###### 21 
Oh that a man might plead with God, as man with his neighbor! 

###### 22 
For the years accounted come, and I shall go the way, whence I shall not return.
