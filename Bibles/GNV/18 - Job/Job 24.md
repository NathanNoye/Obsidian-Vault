###### 1 
How should not the times be hid from the Almighty, seeing that they which know him, see not his days? 

###### 2 
_Some_ remove the landmarks, that rob the flocks and feed _thereof_. 

###### 3 
They lead away the ass of the fatherless, _and_ take the widow's ox to pledge. 

###### 4 
They make the poor to turn out of the way, so that the poor of the earth hide themselves together. 

###### 5 
Behold, _others as_ wild asses in the wilderness, go forth to their business, and rise early for a prey: the wilderness _giveth_ him _and_ his children food. 

###### 6 
They reap his provision in the field, but they gather the late vintage of the wicked. 

###### 7 
They cause the naked to lodge without garment, and without covering in the cold. 

###### 8 
They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and they embrace the rock for want of a covering. 

###### 9 
They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take the pledge of the poor. 

###### 10 
They cause him to go naked without clothing, and take the gleaning from the hungry. 

###### 11 
They that make oil between their walls, and tread their winepresses, suffer thirst. 

###### 12 
Men cry out of the city, and the souls of the slain cry out: yet God doth not charge them with folly. 

###### 13 
These are they that abhor the light: they know not the ways thereof, nor continue in the paths thereof. 

###### 14 
The murderer riseth early, _and_ killeth the poor and the needy: and in the night he is as a thief. 

###### 15 
The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, and saith, None eye shall see me, and disguiseth his face. 

###### 16 
They dig through houses in the dark, _which_ they marked for themselves in the day: they know not the light. 

###### 17 
But the morning _is _even to them as the shadow of death: if one know them, _they are_ in the terrors of the shadow of death. 

###### 18 
He is swift upon the waters: their portion shall be cursed in the earth: he will not behold the way of the vineyards. 

###### 19 
_As_ the dry ground and heat consume the snow waters, _so shall_ the grave the sinners. 

###### 20 
The pitiful man shall forget him: the worm _shall feel_ his sweetness: he shall be no more remembered, and the wicked shall be broken like a tree. 

###### 21 
He doth evil entreat the barren that doth not bear, neither doeth he good to the widow. 

###### 22 
He draweth also the mighty by his power, _and_ when he riseth up, none is sure of life. 

###### 23 
Though men give him assurance to be in safety, yet his eyes _are_ upon their ways. 

###### 24 
They are exalted for a little, but they are gone, and are brought low as all _others_: they are destroyed, and cut off as the top of an ear of corn. 

###### 25 
But if it be not so, where is he? _or_ who will prove me a liar, and make my words of no value?
