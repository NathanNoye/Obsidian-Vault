###### 1 
At this also mine heart is astonied, and is moved out of his place. 

###### 2 
Hear the sound of his voice, and the noise that goeth out of his mouth. 

###### 3 
He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his light unto the ends of the world. 

###### 4 
After it a noise soundeth: he thundereth with the voice of his majesty, and he will not stay them when his voice is heard. 

###### 5 
God thundereth marvelously with his voice: he worketh great things, which we know not. 

###### 6 
For he saith to the snow, Be thou upon the earth likewise to the small rain and to the great rain of his power. 

###### 7 
With the force _thereof_ he shutteth up every man, that all men may know his work. 

###### 8 
Then the beasts go into the den, and remain in their places. 

###### 9 
The whirlwind cometh out of the South, and the cold from the North wind. 

###### 10 
At the breath of God the frost is given, and the breadth of the waters _is_ made narrow. 

###### 11 
He maketh also the clouds to labor, to water _the earth, and_ scattereth the cloud of his light. 

###### 12 
And it is turned about by his government, that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the whole world: 

###### 13 
Whether it be for punishment, or for his land, or of mercy, he causeth it to come. 

###### 14 
Hearken unto this, O Job: stand and consider the wondrous works of God. 

###### 15 
Didst thou know when God disposed them? and caused the light of his cloud to shine? 

###### 16 
Hast thou known the variety of the cloud, _and_ the wondrous works of him that is perfect in knowledge? 

###### 17 
_Or_ how thy clothes are warm, when he maketh the earth quiet through the South wind? 

###### 18 
Hast thou stretched out the heavens, which are strong, _and_ as a molten glass? 

###### 19 
Tell us what we shall say unto him: _for_ we cannot dispose _our matter_ because of darkness. 

###### 20 
Shall it be told him when I speak? or shall man speak when he shall be destroyed? 

###### 21 
And now men see not the light, which shineth in the clouds, but the wind passeth and cleanseth them. 

###### 22 
The brightness cometh out of the North: the praise _thereof is_ to God, which is terrible. 

###### 23 
_It is_ the Almighty: we cannot find him out: _he is_ excellent in power and judgment, and abundant in justice: he afflicteth not. 

###### 24 
Let men therefore fear him: _for_ he will not regard any that are wise in their own conceit.
