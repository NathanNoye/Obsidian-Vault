###### 1 
Lo, mine eye hath seen all _this_: mine ear hath heard, and understood it. 

###### 2 
I know also as much as you know: I am not inferior unto you. 

###### 3 
But I will speak to the Almighty, and I desire to dispute with God. 

###### 4 
For indeed ye forge lies, and all you are physicians of no value. 

###### 5 
Oh, that you would hold your tongue, that it might be imputed to you for wisdom! 

###### 6 
Now hear my disputation, and give ear to the arguments of my lips. 

###### 7 
Will ye speak wickedly for God's _defense_, and talk deceitfully for his cause? 

###### 8 
Will ye accept his person? or will ye contend for God? 

###### 9 
Is it well that he should seek of you? will you make a lie for him, as one lieth for a man? 

###### 10 
He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept any person. 

###### 11 
Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his fear fall upon you? 

###### 12 
Your memories may be compared unto ashes, _and_ your bodies unto bodies of clay. 

###### 13 
Hold your tongues in my presence, that I may speak, and let come upon what will. 

###### 14 
Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my soul in my hand? 

###### 15 
Lo, though he slay me, _yet_ will I trust in him, and I will reprove my ways in his sight. 

###### 16 
He shall be my salvation also: for the hypocrite shall not come before him. 

###### 17 
Hear diligently my words, and mark my talk. 

###### 18 
Behold now: _if_ I prepare me to judgment, I know that I shall be justified. 

###### 19 
Who is he that will plead with me? for _if_ I now hold my tongue, I die. 

###### 20 
But do not these two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee. 

###### 21 
Withdraw thine hand from me, and let not thy fear make me afraid. 

###### 22 
Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me. 

###### 23 
How many are mine iniquities and sins, show me my rebellion and my sin. 

###### 24 
Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and takest me for thine enemy? 

###### 25 
Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble? 

###### 26 
For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth. 

###### 27 
Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths, and makest the print _thereof_ in the heels of my feet. 

###### 28 
Such a one consumeth like a rotten thing, _and _as a garment that is moth-eaten.
