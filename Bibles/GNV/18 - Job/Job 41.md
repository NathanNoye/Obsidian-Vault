###### 1 
None _is_ so fierce that dare stir him up. Who is he then that can stand before me? 

###### 2 
Who hath prevented me that I should make an end? All under heaven is mine. 

###### 3 
I will not keep silence _concerning_ his parts, nor _his_ power, nor his comely proportion. 

###### 4 
Who can discover the face of his garment? _or_ who shall come to him with a double bridle? 

###### 5 
Who shall open the doors of his face? his teeth are fearful round about. 

###### 6 
The majesty _of his scales is like_ strong shields, _and_ are sure sealed. 

###### 7 
One is set to another, that no wind can come between them. 

###### 8 
One is joined to another: they stick together, that they cannot be sundered. 

###### 9 
His sneezings make the light to shine, and his eyes _are_ like the eyelids of the morning. 

###### 10 
Out of his mouth go lamps, _and_ sparks of fire leap out. 

###### 11 
Out of his nostrils cometh out smoke, as out of a boiling pot or caldron. 

###### 12 
His breath maketh the coals burn: for a flame goeth out of his mouth. 

###### 13 
In his neck remaineth strength, and labor is rejected before his face. 

###### 14 
The members of his body are joined: they are strong in themselves, _and_ cannot be moved. 

###### 15 
His heart is as strong as a stone, and as hard as the nether millstone. 

###### 16 
The mighty are afraid of his majesty, _and_ for fear they faint in themselves. 

###### 17 
When the sword doth touch him, he will not rise up, _nor for_ the spear, dart nor habergeon. 

###### 18 
He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 

###### 19 
The archer cannot make him flee: the stones of the sling are turneth into stubble unto him. 

###### 20 
The darts are counted as straw: and he laugheth at the shaking of the spear. 

###### 21 
Sharp stones are under him, and he spreadeth sharp things upon the mire. 

###### 22 
He maketh the depth to boil like a pot, and maketh the Sea like _a pot_ of ointment. 

###### 23 
He maketh a path to shine after him, one would think the depth as an hoar head. 

###### 24 
In the earth there is none like him: he is made without fear. 

###### 25 
He beholdeth all high things: he is a King over all the children of pride.
