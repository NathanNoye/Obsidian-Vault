###### 1 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

###### 2 
When will ye make an end of _your_ words? cause us to understand, and then we will speak. 

###### 3 
Wherefore are we counted as beasts, _and_ are vile in your sight? 

###### 4 
_Thou art __as one_ that teareth his soul in his anger. Shall the earth be forsaken for thy sake? or the rock removed out of his place? 

###### 5 
Yea, the light of the wicked shall be quenched, and the spark of his fire shall not shine. 

###### 6 
The light shall be dark in his dwelling, and his candle shall be put out with him. 

###### 7 
The steps of his strength shall be restrained, and his own counsel shall cast him down. 

###### 8 
For he is taken in the net by his feet, and he walketh upon the snares. 

###### 9 
The grenne shall take him by the heel, and the chief shall come upon him. 

###### 10 
A snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way. 

###### 11 
Fearfulness shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet. 

###### 12 
His strength shall be famine: and destruction shall be ready at his side. 

###### 13 
It shall devour the inner parts of his skin, _and_ the firstborn of death shall devour his strength. 

###### 14 
His hope shall be rooted out of his dwelling, and shall cause him to go to the king of fear. 

###### 15 
_Fear_ shall dwell in his house (because it is not his) _and_ brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation. 

###### 16 
His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut down. 

###### 17 
His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street. 

###### 18 
They shall drive him out of the light unto darkness, and chase him out of the world. 

###### 19 
He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any posterity in his dwellings. 

###### 20 
The posterity shall be astonied at his day, and fear shall come upon the ancient. 

###### 21 
Surely such are the habitations of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
