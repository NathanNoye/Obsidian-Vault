###### 1 
Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the lion's whelps, 

###### 2 
When they crouch in their places, _and_ remain in the covert to lie in wait? 

###### 3 
Who prepareth for the raven his meat, when his birds cry unto God, wandering for lack of meat? 

###### 4 
Knowest thou the time when the wild goats bring forth young? _or_ dost thou mark when the hinds do calve? 

###### 5 
Canst thou number the months that they fulfill? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth? 

###### 6 
They bow themselves: they bruise their young and cast out their sorrows. 

###### 7 
_Yet_ their young wax fat, and grow up with corn: they go forth and return not unto them. 

###### 8 
Who hath set the wild ass at liberty? or who hath loosed the bonds of the wild ass? 

###### 9 
_It is I_ which have made the wilderness his house, and the salt places his dwellings. 

###### 10 
He derideth the multitude of the city: he heareth not the cry of the driver. 

###### 11 
He seeketh out the mountain for his pasture, and searcheth after every green thing. 

###### 12 
Will the unicorn serve thee? or will he tarry by thy crib? 

###### 13 
Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band _to labor_ in the furrow? or will he plow the valleys after thee? 

###### 14 
Wilt thou trust in him, because his strength is great, and cast off thy labor unto him? 

###### 15 
Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it unto thy barn? 

###### 16 
_Hast thou given_ the pleasant wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich? 

###### 17 
Which leaveth his eggs in the earth, and maketh them hot in the dust, 

###### 18 
And forgetteth that the foot might scatter them, or that the wild beast might break them. 

###### 19 
He showeth himself cruel unto his young ones, _as_ they were not his, _and_ is without fear, as if he travailed in vain. 

###### 20 
For God had deprived him of wisdom, and hath given him no part of understanding. 

###### 21 
When time _is_, he mounteth on high: he mocketh the horse and his rider. 

###### 22 
Hast thou given the horse strength, _or_ covered his neck with neighing? 

###### 23 
Hast thou made him afraid as the grasshopper? his strong neighing is fearful. 

###### 24 
He diggeth in the valley, and rejoiceth in _his_ strength: he goeth forth to meet the harnessed _man_. 

###### 25 
He mocketh at fear, and is not afraid, and turneth not back from the sword, 

###### 26 
_Though_ the quiver rattle against him, the glittering spear and the shield. 

###### 27 
He swalloweth the ground for fierceness and rage, and he believeth not that it is the noise of the trumpet. 

###### 28 
He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha: he smelleth the battle afar off, and the noise of the captains, and the shouting. 

###### 29 
Shall the hawk fly by thy wisdom, _stretching out_ his wings even toward the South? 

###### 30 
Doth the eagle mount up at thy commandment, or make his nest on high? 

###### 31 
She abideth and remaineth in the rock, _even_ upon the top of the rock, and the tower, 

###### 32 
From thence she spieth for meat, _and_ her eyes behold afar off. 

###### 33 
His young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain _are_, there is she. 

###### 34 
Moreover the Lord spake unto Job, and said, 

###### 35 
Is this to learn, to strive with the Almighty? he that reproveth God, let him answer to it. 

###### 36 
¶ Then Job answered the Lord, saying, 

###### 37 
Behold, I am vile: what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth. 

###### 38 
Once have I spoken, but I will answer no more, yea twice, but I will proceed no further.
