###### 1 
Again the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 

###### 2 
Gird up now thy loins like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me. 

###### 3 
Wilt thou disannul my judgment? _or_ wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified? 

###### 4 
Or hast thou an arm like God? or dost thou thunder with a voice like him? 

###### 5 
Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency, and array thyself with beauty and glory. 

###### 6 
Cast abroad the indignation of thy wrath, and behold everyone that is proud, and abase him. 

###### 7 
Look on everyone that is arrogant, _and_ bring him low: and destroy the wicked in their place. 

###### 8 
Hide them in the dust together, _and_ bind their faces in a secret place. 

###### 9 
Then will I confess unto thee also, that thy right hand can save thee. 

###### 10 
¶ Behold now Behemoth (whom I made with thee) which eateth grass as an ox. 

###### 11 
Behold now, his strength _is_ in his loins, and his force _is_ in the navel of his belly. 

###### 12 
_When_ he taketh pleasure, his tail is like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together. 

###### 13 
His bones _are like_ staves of brass, _and_ his small bones like staves of iron. 

###### 14 
He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him, will make his sword to approach unto him. 

###### 15 
Surely the mountains bring him forth grass, where all the beasts of the field play. 

###### 16 
Lieth he under the trees in the covert of the reed and fens? 

###### 17 
Can the trees cover him with their shadow? or can the willows of the river compass him about? 

###### 18 
Behold, he spoileth the river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth. 

###### 19 
He taketh it with his eyes, and thrusteth _his_ nose through whatsoever meeteth him. 

###### 20 
¶ Canst thou draw out Leviathan with an hook, and with a line which thou shalt cast down unto his tongue? 

###### 21 
Canst thou cast an hook into his nose? canst thou pierce his jaws with an angle? 

###### 22 
Will he make many prayers unto thee? _and_ speak thee fair? 

###### 23 
Will he make a covenant with thee? _and_ wilt thou take him as a servant forever? 

###### 24 
Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maids? 

###### 25 
Shall the companions banquet with him? shall they divide him among the merchants? 

###### 26 
Canst thou fill the basket with his skin? or the fishpanier with his head? 

###### 27 
Lay thine hand upon him: remember the battle, _and_ do no more so. 

###### 28 
Behold, his hope is in vain: _for_ shall not one perish even at the sight of him?
