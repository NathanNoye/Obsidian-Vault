###### 1 
But Job answered, and said, 

###### 2 
Though my talk be this day in bitterness, _and_ my plague greater than my groaning, 

###### 3 
Would God _yet_ I knew how to find him, I would enter unto his place. 

###### 4 
I would plead the cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments. 

###### 5 
I would know the words, _that_ he would answer me, and would understand what he would say unto me. 

###### 6 
Would he plead against me with his great power? No, but he would put _strength_ in me. 

###### 7 
There the righteous might reason with him, so I should be delivered forever from my Judge. 

###### 8 
Behold, _if_ I go to the East, he is not there: if to the West, yet I cannot perceive him: 

###### 9 
_If_ to the North where he worketh, yet I cannot see him: he will hide himself in the South, and I cannot behold him. 

###### 10 
But he knoweth my way, _and_ trieth me, _and_ I shall come forth like gold. 

###### 11 
My foot hath followed his steps: his way have I kept, and have not declined: 

###### 12 
Neither have I departed from the commandment of his lips, _and_ I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than mine appointed food. 

###### 13 
Yet he is in one _mind_, and who can turn him? yea, he doeth what his mind desireth. 

###### 14 
For he will perform that which is decreed of me, and many such things _are_ with him. 

###### 15 
Therefore I am troubled at his presence, and in considering it, I am afraid of him. 

###### 16 
For God hath softened mine heart, and the Almighty hath troubled me. 

###### 17 
For I am not cut off in darkness, but he hath hid the darkness from my face.
