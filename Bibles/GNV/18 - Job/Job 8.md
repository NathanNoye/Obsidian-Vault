###### 1 
Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 

###### 2 
How long wilt thou talk of these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth _be as_ a mighty wind? 

###### 3 
Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty subvert justice? 

###### 4 
If thy sons have sinned against him, and he hath sent them into the place of their iniquity, 

###### 5 
_Yet_ if thou wilt early seek unto God, and pray to the Almighty, 

###### 6 
If thou be pure and upright, then surely he will awake up unto thee, and he will make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous. 

###### 7 
And though thy beginning be small, yet thy latter end shall greatly increase. 

###### 8 
Inquire therefore, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to search of their fathers. 

###### 9 
(For we are but of yesterday, and are ignorant: for our days upon earth _are_ but a shadow) 

###### 10 
Shall not they teach thee _and_ tell thee, and utter the words of their heart? 

###### 11 
Can a rush grow without mire? or can the grass grow without water? 

###### 12 
Though it were in green _and_ not cut down, yet shall it wither before any other herb. 

###### 13 
So _are_ the paths of all that forget God, and the hypocrite's hope shall perish. 

###### 14 
His confidence also shall be cut off, and his trust _shall be as_ the house of a spider. 

###### 15 
He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold him fast by it, yet shall it not endure. 

###### 16 
The _tree_ is green before the Sun, and the branches spread over the garden thereof. 

###### 17 
The roots thereof are wrapped about the fountain, _and_ are folded _about_ the house of stones. 

###### 18 
If _any_ pluck it from his place, and it deny, _saying_, I have not seen thee, 

###### 19 
Behold, it will rejoice by this means, that it may grow in another mold. 

###### 20 
Behold, God will not cast away an upright man, neither will he take the wicked by the hand, 

###### 21 
Till he have filled thy mouth with laughter, and thy lips with joy. 

###### 22 
They that hate thee, shall be clothed with shame, and the dwelling of the wicked shall not _remain_.
