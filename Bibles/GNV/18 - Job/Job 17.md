###### 1 
My breath is corrupt: my days are cut off, and the grave _is ready_ for me. 

###### 2 
There are none but mockers with me, and mine eye continueth in their bitterness. 

###### 3 
Lay down now, _and_ put me in surety for thee: who is he, that will touch mine hand? 

###### 4 
For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not set _them_ up on high. 

###### 5 
For the eyes of his children shall fail, that speaketh flattery to _his_ friends. 

###### 6 
He hath also made me a byword of the people, and I am as a tabret before them. 

###### 7 
Mine eye therefore is dim for grief, and all my strength _is_ like a shadow. 

###### 8 
The righteous shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall be moved against the hypocrite. 

###### 9 
But the righteous will hold his way, and he whose hands are pure, shall increase _his_ strength. 

###### 10 
All you therefore turn you, and come now, and I shall not find one wise among you. 

###### 11 
My days are past, mine enterprises are broken, _and_ the thoughts of mine heart 

###### 12 
Have changed the night for the day, and the light that approached, for darkness. 

###### 13 
Though I hope, _yet_ the grave shall be mine house, _and_ I shall make my bed in the dark. 

###### 14 
I shall say to corruption, Thou art my father, _and_ to the worm, Thou art my mother and my sister. 

###### 15 
Where is then now mine hope? or who shall consider the thing that I hoped for? 

###### 16 
They shall go down into the bottom of the pit: surely it shall lie together in the dust.
