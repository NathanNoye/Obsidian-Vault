###### 1 
But now they that are younger than I, mock me: _yea_, they whose fathers I have refused to set with the dogs of my flocks. 

###### 2 
For whereto should the strength of their hands have served me, _seeing_ age perished in them? 

###### 3 
For poverty and famine _they were_ solitary, fleeing into the wilderness, _which is_ dark, desolate and waste. 

###### 4 
They cut up nettles by the bushes, and the juniper roots _was_ their meat. 

###### 5 
They were chased forth from among _men_: they shouted at them, as at a thief. 

###### 6 
Therefore they dwelt in the clefts of rivers, in the holes of the earth and rocks. 

###### 7 
They roared among the bushes, and under the thistles they gathered themselves. 

###### 8 
_They were_ the children of fools, and the children of villains, which were more vile than the earth. 

###### 9 
And now am I their song, and I am their talk. 

###### 10 
They abhor me, _and_ flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face. 

###### 11 
Because that _God_ hath loosed my cord and humbled me, they have loosed the bridle before me. 

###### 12 
The youth rise up at my right hand: they have pushed my feet, and have trode on me _as on_ the paths of their destruction. 

###### 13 
They have destroyed my paths: they took pleasure at my calamity, they had no help. 

###### 14 
They came as a great breach _of waters, and_ under this calamity they come on heaps. 

###### 15 
Fear is turned upon me: _and_ they pursue my soul as the wind, and mine health passeth away as a cloud. 

###### 16 
Therefore my soul is now poured out upon me, and the days of affliction have taken hold on me. 

###### 17 
It pierceth my bones in the night, and my sinews take no rest. 

###### 18 
For the great vehemency is my garments changed, _which_ compasseth me about, as the collar of my coat. 

###### 19 
He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like ashes and dust. 

###### 20 
When I cry unto thee, thou dost not hear me, neither regardest me, _when_ I stand up. 

###### 21 
Thou turnest thyself cruelly against me, and art enemy unto me with the strength of thine hand. 

###### 22 
Thou takest me up _and_ causest me to ride upon the wind, and makest my strength to fail. 

###### 23 
Surely I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all the living. 

###### 24 
Doubtless none can stretch his hand unto the grave, though they cry in his destruction. 

###### 25 
Did not I weep with him that was in trouble? was not my soul in heaviness for the poor? 

###### 26 
Yet when I looked for good, evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness. 

###### 27 
My bowels did boil without rest: _for_ the days of affliction are come upon me. 

###### 28 
I went mourning without sun: I stood up in the Congregation _and_ cried. 

###### 29 
I am a brother to the Dragons, and a companion to the Ostriches. 

###### 30 
My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burnt with heat. 

###### 31 
Therefore mine harp is turned to mourning, and mine organs into the voice of them that weep.
