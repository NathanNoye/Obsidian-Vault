###### 1 
Elihu spake moreover, and said, 

###### 2 
Thinkest thou this right, that thou hast said, I am more righteous than God? 

###### 3 
For thou hast said, What profiteth it thee, and what availeth it me, _to purge me_ from my sin? 

###### 4 
_Therefore_ will I answer thee, and thy companions with thee. 

###### 5 
Look unto the heaven, and see and behold the clouds _which_ are higher than thou. 

###### 6 
If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him, yea, when thy sins be many, what doest thou unto him? 

###### 7 
If thou be righteous, what givest thou unto him? or what receiveth he at thine hand? 

###### 8 
Thy wickedness _may hurt_ a man as thou art: and thy righteousness _may profit_ the son of man. 

###### 9 
They cause many that are oppressed, to cry, _which_ cry out for the violence of the mighty. 

###### 10 
But none saith, Where is God that made me, which giveth songs in the night? 

###### 11 
Which teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and giveth us more wisdom than the fowls of the heaven. 

###### 12 
Then they cry because of the violence of the wicked, but he answereth not. 

###### 13 
Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it. 

###### 14 
Although thou sayest _to God_, Thou wilt not regard it, yet judgment _is_ before him: trust thou in him. 

###### 15 
But now because his anger hath not visited, nor called to count _the evil_ with great extremity, 

###### 16 
Therefore Job openeth his mouth in vain, and multiplieth words without knowledge.
