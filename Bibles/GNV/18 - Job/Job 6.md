###### 1 
But Job answered and said, 

###### 2 
Oh that my grief were well weighed, and my miseries were laid together in the balance! 

###### 3 
For it would be now heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up. 

###### 4 
For the arrows of the Almighty _are_ in me, the venom whereof doth drink up my spirit, _and_ the terrors of God fight against me. 

###### 5 
Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox when he hath fodder? 

###### 6 
That which is unsavory, shall it be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg? 

###### 7 
Such things as my soul refused to touch, as _were_ sorrows, are my meat. 

###### 8 
Oh that I might have my desire, and that God would grant me the thing that I long for! 

###### 9 
That is, that God would destroy me: that he would let his hand go, and cut me off. 

###### 10 
Then should I yet have comfort, (though I burn with sorrow, let him not spare) because I have not denied the words of the Holy one. 

###### 11 
What power have I that I should endure? or what is mine end, if I should prolong my life? 

###### 12 
Is my strength the strength of stones? _or_ is my flesh of brass? 

###### 13 
Is it not so, that there is in me no help? and that strength is taken from me? 

###### 14 
He that is in misery, ought to be comforted of his neighbor: but men have forsaken the fear of the Almighty. 

###### 15 
My brethren have deceived me as a brook, _and_ as the rising of the rivers they pass away. 

###### 16 
Which are blackish with ice, _and_ wherein the snow is hid. 

###### 17 
But in time they are dried up with heat _and_ are consumed: and when it is hot they fail out of their places, 

###### 18 
_Or_ they depart from their way and course, _yea_, they vanish and perish. 

###### 19 
They that go to Tema, considered them, _and_ they that go to Sheba, waited for them. 

###### 20 
_But_ they were confounded: when they hoped, they came thither, and were ashamed. 

###### 21 
Surely now are ye _like_ unto it: ye have seen _my_ fearful plague, and are afraid. 

###### 22 
Was it because I said, Bring unto me? or give a reward to me of your substance? 

###### 23 
And deliver me from the enemy's hand, or ransom me out of the hand of tyrants? 

###### 24 
Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand, wherein I have erred. 

###### 25 
How steadfast are the words of righteousness? and what can any of you justly reprove? 

###### 26 
Do ye imagine to reprove words, that the talk of the afflicted should be as the wind? 

###### 27 
Ye make your wrath to fall upon the fatherless, and dig a pit for your friend. 

###### 28 
Now therefore be content to look upon me: for I will not lie before your face. 

###### 29 
Turn, I pray you, let there be none iniquity: return, I say, _and ye shall see_ yet my righteousness in that behalf. Is there iniquity in my tongue? doth not my mouth feel sorrows?
