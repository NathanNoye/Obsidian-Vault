###### 1 
Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? and _are not_ his days as the days of an hireling? 

###### 2 
As a servant longeth for the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for _the end_ of his work, 

###### 3 
So have I had as an inheritance the months of vanity, and painful nights have been appointed unto me. 

###### 4 
If I laid me down, I said, When shall I arise? and measuring the evening, I am even full with tossing to and fro unto the dawning of the day. 

###### 5 
My flesh is clothed with worms and filthiness of the dust: my skin is rent, and become horrible. 

###### 6 
My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and they are spent without hope. 

###### 7 
Remember that my life is but a wind, _and that_ mine eye shall not return to see pleasure. 

###### 8 
The eye that hath seen me, shall see me no more: thine eyes _are_ upon me, and I shall be no longer. 

###### 9 
_As_ the cloud vanisheth and goeth away, so he that goeth down to the grave, shall come up no more. 

###### 10 
He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him anymore. 

###### 11 
Therefore I will not spare my mouth, _but_ will speak in the trouble of my spirit, _and_ muse in the bitterness of my mind. 

###### 12 
Am I a sea or a whalefish, that thou keepest me in ward? 

###### 13 
When I say, My couch shall relieve me, _and_ my bed shall bring _comfort_ in my meditation, 

###### 14 
Then fearest thou me with dreams, and astonishest me with visions. 

###### 15 
Therefore my soul chooseth rather to be strangled _and_ to die, than _to be in_ my bones. 

###### 16 
I abhor it: I shall not live always: spare me then, for my days _are_ but vanity. 

###### 17 
What is man, that thou dost magnify him, and that thou settest thine heart upon him? 

###### 18 
And dost visit him every morning, and triest him every moment? 

###### 19 
How long will it be _ere_ thou depart from me? thou wilt not let me alone while I may swallow my spittle. 

###### 20 
I have sinned, what shall I do unto thee? O thou preserver of men, why hast thou set me _as a mark_ against thee, so that I am a burden unto myself? 

###### 21 
And why dost thou not pardon my trespass? and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust, and if thou seek me in the morning, I shall not be _found_.
