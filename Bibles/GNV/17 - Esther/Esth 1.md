###### 1 
In the days of Ahasuerus (this is Ahasuerus that reigned from India even unto Ethiopia, over an hundred, and seven and twenty provinces.) 

###### 2 
In those days when the king Ahasuerus sat on his throne, which was in the palace of Shushan, 

###### 3 
In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants, _even_ the power of Persia and Media, and to the captains and governors of the provinces _which were_ before him, 

###### 4 
That he might show the riches _and_ glory of his kingdom, and the honor of his great majesty many days, _even_ an hundred and fourscore days. 

###### 5 
And when these days were expired, the king made a feast to all the people that were found in the palace of Shushan, both unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace, 

###### 6 
_Under_ an hanging of white, green, and blue _cloths_, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple, in silver rings, and pillars of marble: the beds _were_ of gold and of silver upon a pavement of porphyry, and marble and alabaster, and blue color. 

###### 7 
And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, and changed vessel after vessel, and royal wine in abundance, according to the power of the king. 

###### 8 
And the drinking _was_ by an order, none might compel: for so the king had appointed unto all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure. 

###### 9 
¶ The Queen Vashti made a feast also for the women in the royal house of King Ahasuerus. 

###### 10 
Upon the seventh day when the King was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs, (that served in the presence of king Ahasuerus) 

###### 11 
To bring Queen Vashti before the king with the crown royal, that he might show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look upon. 

###### 12 
But the Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's word, which he had given in charge to the eunuchs: therefore the King was very angry, and his wrath kindled in him. 

###### 13 
Then the King said to the wise men, that knew the times (for so was the King's manner towards all that knew the law and the judgment: 

###### 14 
And the next unto him _was_ Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, _and_ Memucan the seven Princes of Persia, and Media, which saw the King's face, and sat the first in the kingdom.) 

###### 15 
What shall we do unto the Queen Vashti according to the law, because she did not according to the word of the King Ahasuerus by the commission of the eunuchs? 

###### 16 
Then Memucan answered before the king and the Princes, The Queen Vashti hath not only done evil against the King, but against all the Princes, and against all the people that are in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 

###### 17 
For the act of the Queen shall come abroad unto all women, so that they shall despise their husbands in their own eyes, and shall say, The King Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the Queen to be brought in before him, but she came not. 

###### 18 
So shall the Princesses of Persia and Media this day say unto all the King's Princes, when they hear of the act of the Queen: thus _shall there be_ much despitefulness and wrath. 

###### 19 
If it please the King, let a royal decree proceed from him, and let it be written among the statutes of Persia and Media, (and let it not be transgressed) that Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus: and let the king give her royal estate unto her companion that is better than she. 

###### 20 
And when the decree of the King which shall be made, shall be published throughout all his kingdom (though it be great) all the women shall give their husbands honor, both great and small. 

###### 21 
And this saying pleased the King and the Princes, and the King did according to the word of Memucan. 

###### 22 
For he sent letters into all the provinces of the King, into every province according to the writing thereof, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that he should publish it in the language of that same people.
