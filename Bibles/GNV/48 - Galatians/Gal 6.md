###### 1 
Brethren, If a man be suddenly taken in any offense, ye which are spiritual, restore such one with the spirit of meekness, considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted. 

###### 2 
Bear ye one another's burden, and so fulfill the Law of Christ. 

###### 3 
For if any man seem to himself, that he is somewhat, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself in his imagination. 

###### 4 
But let every man prove his own work: and then shall he have rejoicing in himself only and not in another. 

###### 5 
For every man shall bear his own burden. 

###### 6 
Let him that is taught in the word, make him that hath taught him, partaker of all _his_ goods. 

###### 7 
Be not deceived: God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. 

###### 8 
For he that soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corruption: but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting. 

###### 9 
Let us not therefore be weary of well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not. 

###### 10 
While we have therefore time, let us do good unto all men, but especially unto them, which are of the household of faith. 

###### 11 
¶ Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand. 

###### 12 
As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised, only because they would not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ. 

###### 13 
For they themselves which are circumcised keep not the Law, but desire to have you circumcised, that they might rejoice in your flesh. 

###### 14 
But God forbid that I should rejoice, but in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world. 

###### 15 
For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature. 

###### 16 
And as many as walk according to this rule, peace _shall be_ upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. 

###### 17 
From henceforth let no man put me to business: for I bear, in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. 

###### 18 
Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with your spirit, Amen. ¶ Unto the Galatians written from Rome.
