###### 1 
Then I say, that the heir as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be Lord of all, 

###### 2 
But is under tutors and governors, until the time appointed of the Father. 

###### 3 
Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the rudiments of the world. 

###### 4 
But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a woman, _and_ made under the Law, 

###### 5 
That he might redeem them which were under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of the sons. 

###### 6 
And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, which crieth, Abba, Father. 

###### 7 
Wherefore, thou art no more a servant, but a son: now if _thou be_ a son, _thou art_ also the heir of God through Christ. 

###### 8 
But even then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them, which by nature are not gods: 

###### 9 
But now seeing ye know God, yea, rather are known of God, how turn ye again unto impotent and beggarly rudiments, whereunto _as_ from the beginning ye will be in bondage again? 

###### 10 
Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. 

###### 11 
I am in fear of you, lest I have bestowed on you labor in vain. 

###### 12 
Be ye as I (for I am even as you) brethren, I beseech you: ye have not hurt me at all. 

###### 13 
And ye know, how through infirmity of the flesh, I preached the Gospel unto you at the first. 

###### 14 
And the trial of me which was in my flesh, ye despised not, neither abhorred: but ye received me as an Angel of God, _yea_, as Christ Jesus. 

###### 15 
What was then your felicity? for I bear you record, that if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them unto me. 

###### 16 
Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? 

###### 17 
They are jealous over you amiss: yea, they would exclude you, that ye should altogether love them. 

###### 18 
But it is a good thing to love earnestly always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you, 

###### 19 
My little children, of whom I travail in birth again, until Christ be formed in you. 

###### 20 
And I would I were with you now, that I might change my voice: for I am in doubt of you. 

###### 21 
Tell me, ye that will be under the Law, do ye not hear the Law? 

###### 22 
For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by a servant, and one by a free woman. 

###### 23 
But he which was of the servant, was born after the flesh: and he which was of the free woman, _was born_ by promise. 

###### 24 
By the which things another thing is meant: for these _mothers_ are the two Testaments, the one which is Hagar of mount Sinai, which gendereth unto bondage. 

###### 25 
(For Hagar _or_ Sinai is a mountain in Arabia, and it answered to Jerusalem which now is) and she is in bondage with her children. 

###### 26 
But Jerusalem, which is above, is free: which is the mother of us all. 

###### 27 
For it is written, Rejoice thou barren that bearest no children: break forth, and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children, than she which hath an husband. 

###### 28 
Therefore, brethren, we are after the manner of Isaac, children of the promise. 

###### 29 
But as then he that was born after the flesh, persecuted him that _was born_ after the Spirit, even so _it is_ now. 

###### 30 
But what saith the Scripture? Put out the servant and her son: for the son of the servant shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. 

###### 31 
Then brethren, we are not children of the servant, but of the free woman.
