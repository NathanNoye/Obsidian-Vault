###### 1 
Paul an Apostle (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father which hath raised him from the dead.) 

###### 2 
And all the brethren which are with me unto the Churches of Galatia: 

###### 3 
Grace _be_ with you, and peace from God the Father, and _from_ our Lord Jesus Christ, 

###### 4 
Which gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world according to the will of God even our Father, 

###### 5 
To whom _be_ glory forever and ever, Amen. 

###### 6 
I marvel that ye are so soon removed away unto another Gospel, from him that had called you in the grace of Christ, 

###### 7 
Which is not another _Gospel_, save that there be some which trouble you, and intend to pervert the Gospel of Christ. 

###### 8 
But though that we, or an Angel from heaven preach unto you otherwise than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. 

###### 9 
As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach unto you otherwise than that ye have received, let him be accursed. 

###### 10 
For now preach I man's _doctrine_, or God's? or go I about to please men? for if I should yet please men, I were not the servant of Christ. 

###### 11 
Now I certify you, brethren, that the Gospel which was preached of me, was not after man. 

###### 12 
For neither received I it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. 

###### 13 
For ye have heard of my conversation in time past, in the Jewish religion, how that I persecuted the Church of God extremely, and wasted it, 

###### 14 
And profited in the Jewish religion above many of my companions of mine own nation, and was much more zealous of the traditions of my fathers. 

###### 15 
But when it pleased God (which had separated me from my mother's womb, and called _me_ by his grace.) 

###### 16 
To reveal his Son in me, that I should preach him among the Gentiles immediately, I communicated not with flesh and blood: 

###### 17 
Neither came I again to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me, but I went into Arabia, and turned again unto Damascus. 

###### 18 
Then after three years I came again to Jerusalem, to visit Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. 

###### 19 
And none other of the Apostles saw I, save James the Lord's brother. 

###### 20 
Now the things which I write unto you, behold, _I witness_ before God, that I lie not. 

###### 21 
After that, I went into the coasts of Syria and Cilicia: for I was unknown by face unto the Churches of Judea which were in Christ. 

###### 22 
But they had heard only _some say_, He which persecuted us in time past, now preacheth the faith which before he destroyed. 

###### 23 
And they glorified God for me.
