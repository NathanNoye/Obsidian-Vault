###### 1 
Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. 

###### 2 
Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. 

###### 3 
For I testify again to every man, which is circumcised, that he is bound to keep the whole Law. 

###### 4 
Ye are abolished from Christ: whosoever are justified by the Law, ye are fallen from grace. 

###### 5 
For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness through faith. 

###### 6 
For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth anything, neither uncircumcision, but faith which worketh by love. 

###### 7 
Ye did run well: who did let you, that ye did not obey the truth? 

###### 8 
_It is_ not the persuasion of him that calleth you. 

###### 9 
A little leaven doth leaven the whole lump. 

###### 10 
I have trust in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you, shall bear _his_ condemnation, whosoever he be. 

###### 11 
And brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? Then is the slander of the cross abolished. 

###### 12 
Would to God they were even cut off which do disquiet you. 

###### 13 
For brethren, ye have been called unto liberty: only use not _your_ liberty as an occasion unto the flesh, but by love serve one another. 

###### 14 
For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, which is this, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. 

###### 15 
If ye bite and devour one another, take heed lest ye be consumed one of another. 

###### 16 
Then I say, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh. 

###### 17 
For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary one to another, so that ye cannot do the same things that ye would. 

###### 18 
And if ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law. 

###### 19 
Moreover the works of the flesh are manifest, which are adultery, fornication, uncleanness, wantonness, 

###### 20 
Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, debate, emulations, wrath, contentions, seditions, heresies, 

###### 21 
Envy, murders, drunkenness, gluttony, and such like, whereof I tell you before, as I also have told you before, that they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God. 

###### 22 
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, 

###### 23 
Meekness, temperancy: against such there is no law. 

###### 24 
For they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lusts. 

###### 25 
If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. 

###### 26 
Let us not be desirous of vainglory, provoking one another, envying one another.
