###### 1 
Behold, what love the Father hath given to us, that we should be called the sons of God: For this cause this world knoweth you not, because it knoweth not him. 

###### 2 
Dearly beloved, now are we the sons of God, but yet it is not made manifest what we shall be: and we know that when he shall be made manifest: we shall be like him: for we shall see him as he is. 

###### 3 
And every man that hath this hope in him purgeth himself, even as he is pure. 

###### 4 
Whosoever commiteth sin, transgresseth also the Law: for sin is the transgression of the Law. 

###### 5 
And ye know that he was made manifest, that he might take away our sins, and in him is no sin. 

###### 6 
Whosoever abideth in him, sinneth not: whosoever sinneth, hath not seen him, neither hath known him. 

###### 7 
Little children, let no man deceive you, he that doeth righteousness, is righteous, as he is righteous. 

###### 8 
He that commiteth sin, is of the devil: for the devil sinneth from the beginning: for this purpose was made manifest that Son of God, that he might loose the works of the devil. 

###### 9 
Whosoever is born of God sinneth not: for his seed remaineth in him, neither can he sin, because he is born of God. 

###### 10 
In this are the children of God known, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness, is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother. 

###### 11 
For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another, 

###### 12 
Not as Cain _which_ was of that wicked one, and slew his brother: and wherefore slew he him? because his own works were evil, and his brother's good. 

###### 13 
Marvel not my brethren, though this world hate you. 

###### 14 
We know that we are translated from death unto life, because we love the brethren: he that loveth not _his_ brother, abideth in death. 

###### 15 
Whosoever hateth his brother, is a manslayer: and ye know that no manslayer hath eternal life abiding in him. 

###### 16 
Hereby have we perceived love, that he laid down his life for us: therefore we ought also to lay down _our_ lives for the brethren. 

###### 17 
And whosoever hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? 

###### 18 
My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue _only_, but in deed and in truth. 

###### 19 
For thereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall before him assure our hearts. 

###### 20 
For if our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. 

###### 21 
Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we boldness toward God. 

###### 22 
And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing in his sight. 

###### 23 
This is then his commandment, that we believe in the Name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave commandment. 

###### 24 
For he that keepeth his commandments, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we know that he abideth in us, _even_ by that Spirit which he hath given us.
