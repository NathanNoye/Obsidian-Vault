###### 1 
That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with these our eyes, which we have looked upon, and these hands of ours have handled of that word of life, 

###### 2 
(For that life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show unto you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was made manifest unto us.) 

###### 3 
That _I say_, which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye may also have fellowship with us, and that our fellowship also may be with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. 

###### 4 
And these things write I unto you, that your joy may be full. 

###### 5 
This then is the message, which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness. 

###### 6 
If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not truly. 

###### 7 
But if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. 

###### 8 
If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and truth is not in us. 

###### 9 
If we acknowledge our sins, he is faithful and just, to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 

###### 10 
If we say, we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
