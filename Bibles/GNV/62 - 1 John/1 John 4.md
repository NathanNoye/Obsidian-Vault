###### 1 
Dearly beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: for many false Prophets are gone out into the world. 

###### 2 
Hereby shall ye know the Spirit of God, Every spirit which confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. 

###### 3 
And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: but this is the _spirit_ of Antichrist, of whom ye have heard, how that he should come, and now already he is in this world. 

###### 4 
Little children, ye are of God, and have overcome them: for greater is he that is in you, than he that is in this world. 

###### 5 
They are of this world, therefore spake they of this world, and this world heareth them. 

###### 6 
We are of God, he that knoweth God, heareth us: he that is not of God heareth us not. Hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the spirit of error. 

###### 7 
Beloved, let us love one another: for love cometh of God, and everyone that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. 

###### 8 
He that loveth not, knoweth not God, for God is love. 

###### 9 
Herein was that love of God made manifest amongst us, because God sent that his only begotten Son into this world, that we might live through him. 

###### 10 
Herein is that love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son _to be _a reconciliation for our sins. 

###### 11 
Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another. 

###### 12 
No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfect in us. 

###### 13 
Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, and he in us: because he hath given us of his Spirit. 

###### 14 
And we have seen, and do testify, that the Father sent the Son _to be_ the Savior of the world. 

###### 15 
Whosoever confesseth that Jesus is the Son of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God. 

###### 16 
And we have known, and believed the love that God hath in us, God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. 

###### 17 
Herein is that love perfect in us, that we should have boldness in the day of judgment: for as he is, even so are we in this world. 

###### 18 
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear: for fear hath painfulness: and he that feareth, is not perfect in love. 

###### 19 
We love him, because he loved us first. 

###### 20 
If any man say, I love God, and hate his brother, he is a liar: for how can he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, love God whom he hath not seen? 

###### 21 
And this commandment have we of him, that he that loveth God, should love his brother also.
