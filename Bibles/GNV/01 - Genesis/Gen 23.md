###### 1 
When Sarah was an hundred twenty and seven years old (so long lived she.) 

###### 2 
Then Sarah died in Kirjath Arba: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. And Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 

###### 3 
¶ Then Abraham rose up from the sight of his corpse, and talked with the Hittites, saying, 

###### 4 
I am a stranger, and a foreigner among you: give me a possession of burial with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 

###### 5 
Then the Hittites answered Abraham, saying unto him, 

###### 6 
Hear us, my lord: thou art a prince of God among us: in the chiefest of our sepulchers bury the dead: none of us shall forbid thee his sepulcher, but thou mayest bury thy dead _therein_. 

###### 7 
Then Abraham stood up, and bowed himself before the people of the land of the Hittites. 

###### 8 
And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind, that I shall bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 

###### 9 
That he would give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath in the end of his field: that he would give it me for as much money as it is worth, for a possession to bury in among you. 

###### 10 
(For Ephron dwelt among the Hittites) Then Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of all the Hittites that went in at the gates of his city, saying, 

###### 11 
No, my Lord, hear me: the field give I thee and the cave that therein is, I give it thee: _even_ in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee to bury thy dead. 

###### 12 
Then Abraham bowed himself before the people of the land, 

###### 13 
And spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the country, saying, Seeing thou _wilt give it_, I pray thee, hear me, I will give the price of the field: receive it of me, and I will bury my dead there. 

###### 14 
Ephron then answered Abraham, saying unto him, 

###### 15 
My lord, hearken unto me: the land _is worth_ four hundred shekels of silver: what _is_ that between me and thee? bury therefore thy dead. 

###### 16 
So Abraham hearkened unto Ephron, and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named, in the audience of the Hittites, _even_ four hundred silver shekels of current money among merchants. 

###### 17 
¶ So the field of Ephron _which was_ in Machpelah, and over against Mamre, _even_ the field and the cave that was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, which were in all the borders round about, was made sure 

###### 18 
Unto Abraham for a possession, in the sight of the Hittites, _even_ of all that went in at the gates of his city. 

###### 19 
And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah over against Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan. 

###### 20 
Thus the field, and the cave that is therein, was made sure unto Abraham for a possession of burial by the Hittites.
