###### 1 
Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham and Japheth: unto whom sons were born after the flood. 

###### 2 
The sons of Japheth _were_ Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras. 

###### 3 
And the sons of Gomer, Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah. 

###### 4 
Also the sons of Javan, Elishah and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 

###### 5 
Of these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands, every man after his tongue, _and_ after their families in their nations. 

###### 6 
¶ Moreover, the sons of Ham _were_ Cush, and Mizraim, and Put, and Canaan. 

###### 7 
And the sons of Cush, Seba and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtechah: also the sons of Raamah _were_ Sheba and Dedan. 

###### 8 
And Cush begat Nimrod, who began to be mighty in the earth. 

###### 9 
He was a mighty hunter before the Lord. Wherefore it is said, As Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord. 

###### 10 
And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar. 

###### 11 
Out of that land came Assyria, and built Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah: 

###### 12 
Resen also between Nineveh and Calah: this is a great city. 

###### 13 
And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim. 

###### 14 
Pathrusim also, and Casluhim (out of whom came the Philistines) and Caphtorims. 

###### 15 
Also Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth, 

###### 16 
And Jebusi, and Emori, and Girgashi, 

###### 17 
And Hivi, and Arki, and Sini, 

###### 18 
And Arvadi, and Zemari, and Hamathi: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad. 

###### 19 
Then the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar until Gaza, and as thou goest unto Sodom and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboiim, even unto Lasha. 

###### 20 
These are the sons of Ham according to their families, according to their tongues in their countries, _and_ in their nations. 

###### 21 
¶ Unto Shem also the father of all the sons of Eber, and elder brother of Japheth were children born. 

###### 22 
The sons of Shem _were_ Elam and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram. 

###### 23 
And the sons of Aram, Uz and Hul, and Gether, and Mash. 

###### 24 
Also Arphaxad begat Salah, and Salah begat Eber. 

###### 25 
Unto Eber also were born two sons: the name of the one _was_ Peleg: for in his days was the earth divided: and his brother's name _was_ Joktan. 

###### 26 
Then Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah, 

###### 27 
And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah, 

###### 28 
And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba, 

###### 29 
And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these _were_ the sons of Joktan. 

###### 30 
And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest up to Sephar, a mount of the East. 

###### 31 
These are the sons of Shem, according to their families, according to their tongues in their countries and nations. 

###### 32 
These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations among their people: and out of these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.
