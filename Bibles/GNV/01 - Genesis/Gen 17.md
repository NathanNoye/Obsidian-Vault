###### 1 
When Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am God all sufficient, walk before me, and be thou upright, 

###### 2 
And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and I will multiply thee exceedingly. 

###### 3 
Then Abram fell on his face, and God talked with him, saying, 

###### 4 
Behold, I _make_ my covenant with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many nations, 

###### 5 
Neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram, but thy name shall be Abraham: for a father of many nations have I made thee. 

###### 6 
Also I will make thee exceedingly fruitful, and will make nations of thee, yea, Kings shall proceed of thee. 

###### 7 
Moreover, I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee in their generations, for an everlasting covenant, to be God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. 

###### 8 
And I will give thee and thy seed after thee the land, wherein thou art a stranger, _even_ all the land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession, and I will be their God. 

###### 9 
¶ Again God said unto Abraham, Thou also shalt keep my covenant, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations. 

###### 10 
This is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you, and thy seed after thee, Let every man-child among you be circumcised: 

###### 11 
That is, ye shall circumcise the foreskin of your flesh, and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and you. 

###### 12 
And every man-child of eight days old among you, shall be circumcised in your generations, as well he that is born in _thine_ house, as he that is bought with money of any stranger, which is not of thy seed. 

###### 13 
He that is born in thine house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised: so my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 

###### 14 
But the uncircumcised man-child, in whose flesh the foreskin is not circumcised, even that person shall be cut off from his people, _because_ he hath broken my covenant. 

###### 15 
¶ Afterward God said unto Abraham, Sarai thy wife shalt thou not call Sarai, but Sarah _shall be_ her name. 

###### 16 
And I will bless her, and will also give thee a son of her, yea, I will bless her, and she shall be _the mother_ of nations: Kings _also_ of people shall come of her. 

###### 17 
Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his heart, Shall a child be born unto him, that is an hundred years old? and shall Sarah that is ninety years old, bear? 

###### 18 
And Abraham said unto God, Oh, that Ishmael might live in thy sight. 

###### 19 
Then God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed, and thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, _and_ with his seed after him. 

###### 20 
And as concerning Ishmael, I have heard thee: lo, I have blessed him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly: twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make a great nation of him. 

###### 21 
But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall bear unto thee, the next year at this season. 

###### 22 
And he left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham. 

###### 23 
¶ Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in his house, and all that was bought with his money, _that is_, every man-child among the men of Abraham's house, and he circumcised the foreskin of their flesh in that selfsame day, as God had commanded him. 

###### 24 
Abraham also himself was ninety years old and nine, when the foreskin of his flesh was circumcised. 

###### 25 
And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when the foreskin of his flesh was circumcised. 

###### 26 
The selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his son: 

###### 27 
And all the men of his house _both_ born in his house, and bought with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.
