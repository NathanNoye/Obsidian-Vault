###### 1 
Now these are the generations of Esau, which is Edom. 

###### 2 
Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon an Hittite and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon an Hivite. 

###### 3 
And _took_ Basemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.

And Adah bare unto Esau, Eliphaz: and Basemath bare Reuel, 

###### 5 
Also Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau which were born to him in the land of Canaan. 

###### 6 
So Esau took his wives and his sons, and his daughters, and all the souls of his house, and his flocks, and all his cattle, and all his substance, which he had gotten in the land of Canaan, and went into _another_ country from his brother Jacob. 

###### 7 
For their riches were so great, that they could not dwell together, and the land, wherein they were strangers, could not receive them because of their flocks. 

###### 8 
Therefore dwelt Esau in mount Seir: this Esau is Edom.

These are the Dukes of the Horites: Duke Lotan, Duke Shobal, Duke Zibeon, Duke Anah, 

###### 30 
Duke Dishon, Duke Ezer, Duke Dishan: these be the Dukes of the Horites, after their Dukedoms in the land of Seir. 

###### 31 
¶ And these are the Kings that reigned in the land of Edom, before there reigned _any_ King over the children of Israel. 

###### 32 
Then Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city _was_ Dinhabah.
