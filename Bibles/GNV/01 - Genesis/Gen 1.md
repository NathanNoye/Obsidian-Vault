###### 1 
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 

###### 2 
And the earth was without form and void, and darkness _was_ upon the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the waters. 

###### 3 
Then God said, Let there be light: And there was light. 

###### 4 
And God saw the light that it was good, and God separated the light from the darkness. 

###### 5 
And God called the Light, Day, and the darkness he called Night. So the evening and the morning were the first day. 

###### 6 
¶ Again God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters. 

###### 7 
Then God made the firmament, and separated the waters, which were under the firmament, from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so. 

###### 8 
And God called the firmament, Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day. 

###### 9 
¶ God said again, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered into one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so. 

###### 10 
And God called the dry land, Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters, Seas: and God saw that it was good. 

###### 11 
Then God said, Let the earth bud forth the bud of the herb, that seedeth seed, the fruitful tree, which beareth fruit according to his kind, which hath his seed in itself upon the earth: and it was so. 

###### 12 
And the earth brought forth the bud of the herb, that seedeth seed according to his kind, also the tree that beareth fruit, which hath his seed in itself according to his kind: and God saw that it was good. 

###### 13 
So the evening and the morning were the third day. 

###### 14 
¶ And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to separate the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years. 

###### 15 
And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so. 

###### 16 
God then made two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he _made_ also the stars. 

###### 17 
And God set them in the firmament of the heaven, to shine upon the earth, 

###### 18 
And to rule in the day, and in the night, and to separate the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good. 

###### 19 
So the evening and the morning were the fourth day. 

###### 20 
Afterward God said, Let the waters bring forth in abundance _every_ creeping thing that hath life: and let the fowl fly upon the earth in the open firmament of the heaven. 

###### 21 
Then God created the great whales, and everything living and moving, which the waters brought forth in abundance according to their kind, and every feathered fowl according to his kind: and God saw that it was good. 

###### 22 
Then God blessed them, saying, Bring forth fruit and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let the fowl multiply in the earth. 

###### 23 
So the evening and the morning were the fifth day. 

###### 24 
¶ Moreover God said, Let the earth bring forth the living thing according to his kind, cattle, and that which creepeth, and the beast of the earth according to his kind, and it was so. 

###### 25 
And God made the beast of the earth according to his kind, and the cattle according to his kind, and every creeping thing of the earth according to his kind: and God saw that it was good. 

###### 26 
Furthermore God said, Let us make man in our image according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over the beasts, and over all the earth, and over everything that creepeth and moveth on the earth. 

###### 27 
Thus God created the man in his image: in the image of God created he him: he created them male and female. 

###### 28 
And God blessed them, and God said to them, Bring forth fruit, and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the heaven, and over every beast that moveth upon the earth. 

###### 29 
And God said, Behold, I have given unto you every herb bearing seed, which is upon all the earth, and every tree, wherein is the fruit of a tree bearing seed: _that_ shall be to you for meat. 

###### 30 
Likewise to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the heaven, and to everything that moveth upon the earth, which hath life in itself, every green herb _shall be_ for meat, and it was so. 

###### 31 
And God saw all that he had made, and lo, it was very good. So the evening and the morning were the sixth day.
