###### 1 
Now God remembered Noah and every beast, and all the cattle that were with him in the Ark: therefore God made a wind to pass upon the earth, and the waters ceased. 

###### 2 
The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained. 

###### 3 
And the waters returned from above the earth, going and returning: and after the end of the hundred and fiftieth day the waters abated. 

###### 4 
And in the seventh month, in the seventeenth day of the month, the Ark rested upon the mountains of Ararat. 

###### 5 
And the waters were going and decreasing until the tenth month: in the tenth month, and in the first day of the month, were the tops of the mountains seen. 

###### 6 
¶ So after forty days, Noah opened the window of the Ark which he had made, 

###### 7 
And sent forth a raven, which went out, going forth and returning, until the waters were dried up upon the earth. 

###### 8 
Again he sent a dove from him, that he might see if the waters were diminished from off the earth. 

###### 9 
But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot: therefore she returned unto him into the Ark (for the waters _were_ upon the whole earth) and he put forth his hand, and received her, and took her to him into the Ark. 

###### 10 
And he abode yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the Ark. 

###### 11 
And the dove came to him in the evening, and lo in her mouth _was_ an olive leaf that she had plucked: whereby Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 

###### 12 
Notwithstanding, he waited yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove, which returned not again unto him anymore. 

###### 13 
¶ And in the six hundred and one year, in the first _day_ of the first month, the waters were dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of the Ark, and looked, and behold, the upper part of the ground was dry. 

###### 14 
And in the second month, in the seven and twentieth day of the month, was the earth dry. 

###### 15 
¶ Then God spake to Noah, saying, 

###### 16 
Go forth of the Ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy sons' wives with thee. 

###### 17 
Bring forth with thee every beast that is with thee, of all flesh, _both_ fowl and cattle, and everything that creepeth and moveth upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly in the earth, and bring forth fruit and increase upon the earth. 

###### 18 
So Noah came forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him. 

###### 19 
Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, all that moveth upon the earth, after their kinds, went out of the Ark. 

###### 20 
¶ Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt offerings upon the altar. 

###### 21 
And the Lord smelled a savor of rest, and the Lord said in his heart, I will henceforth curse the ground no more for man's cause: for the imagination of man's heart _is_ evil, _even_ from his youth: neither will I smite anymore all things living, as I have done. 

###### 22 
Hereafter seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and Summer and Winter, and day and night shall not cease, so long as the earth remaineth.
