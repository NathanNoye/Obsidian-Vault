###### 1 
Afterward he commanded his steward, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth. 

###### 2 
And put my cup, _I mean_, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the commandment that Joseph gave _him_. 

###### 3 
And in the morning the men were sent away, they, and their asses. 

###### 4 
And when they went out of the city not far off, Joseph said to his steward, Up, follow after the men: and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good? 

###### 5 
Is not that _the cup_ wherein my lord drinketh? and in the which he doth divine and prophesy? ye have done evil in so doing. 

###### 6 
¶ And when he overtook them, he said these words unto them. 

###### 7 
And they answered him, Wherefore saith my lord such words? God forbid that thy servants should do such a thing. 

###### 8 
Behold, the money which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold? 

###### 9 
With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen. 

###### 10 
And he said, Now then let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found, shall be my servant, and ye shall be blameless. 

###### 11 
Then at once every man took down his sack to the ground, and everyone opened his sack. 

###### 12 
And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack. 

###### 13 
Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and went again into the city. 

###### 14 
¶ So Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house (for he _was_ yet there) and they fell before him on the ground. 

###### 15 
Then Joseph said unto them, What act is this, which ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I, can divine and prophesy? 

###### 16 
Then said Judah, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we speak? and how can we justify ourselves? God hath found out the wickedness of thy servants: behold, we _are_ servants to my lord, both we, and he, with whom the cup is found. 

###### 17 
But he answered, God forbid, that I should do so, _but_ the man, with whom the cup is found, he shall be my servant, and go ye in peace unto your father. 

###### 18 
¶ Then Judah drew near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant now speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thy wrath be kindled against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. 

###### 19 
My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? 

###### 20 
And we answered my lord, We have a father that is old, and a young child, _which he begat_ in his age: and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him. 

###### 21 
Now thou saidest unto thy servants, Bring him unto me, that I may set mine eye upon him. 

###### 22 
And we answered my lord, The child cannot depart his father: for if he leave his father, _his father_ would die. 

###### 23 
Then saidest thou unto thy servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, look in my face no more. 

###### 24 
So when we came unto thy servant our father, and showed him what my lord had said, 

###### 25 
And our father said unto us, Go again, buy us a little food. 

###### 26 
Then we answered, We cannot go down, _but_ if our youngest brother go with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us. 

###### 27 
Then thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two _sons_. 

###### 28 
And the one went out from me, and I said, Of a surety he is torn in pieces, and I saw him not since. 

###### 29 
Now ye take this also away from me: if death take him, then ye shall bring my gray head in sorrow to the grave. 

###### 30 
Now therefore, when I come to thy servant my father, and the child be not with us (seeing that his life dependeth on the _child's_ life.) 

###### 31 
Then when he shall see that the child _is_ not _come_, he will die: so shall thy servants bring down the gray head of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave. 

###### 32 
Doubtless thy servant became surety for the child to my father, and, If I bring him not unto thee again, then I will bear the blame unto my father forever. 

###### 33 
Now therefore, I pray thee, let me thy servant abide for the child, _as_ a servant to my lord, and let the child go up with his brethren. 

###### 34 
For how can I go up to my father: if the child _be_ not with me, unless I would see the evil that shall come on my father.
