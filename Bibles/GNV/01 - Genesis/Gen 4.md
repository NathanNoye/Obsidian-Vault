###### 1 
Afterward the man knew Eve his wife which conceived and bare Cain, and said, I have obtained a man by the Lord. 

###### 2 
And again she brought forth his brother Abel, and Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain was a tiller of the ground. 

###### 3 
¶ And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought an oblation unto the Lord of the fruit of the ground. 

###### 4 
And Abel also himself brought of the firstfruits of his sheep, and of the fat of them, and the Lord had respect unto Abel, and to his offering, 

###### 5 
But unto Cain and to his offering he had no regard: wherefore Cain was exceedingly wroth and his countenance fell down. 

###### 6 
Then the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is thy countenance cast down? 

###### 7 
If thou do well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door: also unto thee his desire _shall be subject_, and thou shalt rule over him. 

###### 8 
¶ Then Cain spake unto Abel his brother. And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. 

###### 9 
Then the Lord said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? Who answered, I cannot tell. Am I my brother's keeper? 

###### 10 
Again he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me, from the earth. 

###### 11 
Now therefore thou art cursed from the earth, which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thine hand. 

###### 12 
When thou shalt till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield unto thee her strength: a vagabond and a runagate shalt thou be in the earth. 

###### 13 
Then Cain said to the Lord, My punishment is greater than I can bear. 

###### 14 
Behold, thou hast cast me out this day from the earth, and from thy face shall I be hid, and shall be a vagabond, and a runagate in the earth, and whosoever findeth me shall slay me. 

###### 15 
Then the Lord said unto him, Doubtless whosoever slayeth Cain, he shall be punished seven fold. And the Lord set a mark upon Cain, lest any man finding him, should kill him. 

###### 16 
Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord, and dwelt in the land of Nod toward the East side of Eden. 

###### 17 
Cain also knew his wife, which conceived and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city by the name of his son, Enoch. 

###### 18 
And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begat Mehujael, and Mehujael begat Methushael, and Methushael begat Lamech. 

###### 19 
¶ And Lamech took to him two wives: the name of the one _was_ Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. 

###### 20 
And Adah bare Jabal, who was the father of such as dwell in the tents, and of such as have cattle. 

###### 21 
And his brother's name _was_ Jubal, who was the father of all that play on the harp and organs. 

###### 22 
And Zillah also bore Tubal-Cain, who wrought cunningly every craft of brass and of iron: and the sister of Tubal-Cain _was_ Naamah. 

###### 23 
Then Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech; hearken unto my speech: for I would slay a man in my wound, and a young man to mine hurt. 

###### 24 
If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy times sevenfold. 

###### 25 
¶ And Adam knew his wife again, and she bare a son, and she called his name Seth: for God, _said she_, hath appointed me another seed for Abel, because Cain slew him. 

###### 26 
And to the same Seth also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then began men to call upon the name of the Lord.
