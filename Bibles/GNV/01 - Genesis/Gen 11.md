###### 1 
Then the whole earth was of one language and one speech. 

###### 2 
And as they went from the East, they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and there they abode. 

###### 3 
And they said one to another, Come, let us make brick and burn it in the fire, so they had brick for stone, and slime had they instead of mortar. 

###### 4 
Also they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top _may reach_ unto the heaven, that we may get us a name, lest we be scattered upon the whole earth. 

###### 5 
But the Lord came down, to see the city and tower which the sons of men built. 

###### 6 
And the Lord said, Behold, the people _is_ one, and they all have one language, and this they begin to do, neither can they now be stopped from whatsoever they have imagined to do. 

###### 7 
Come on, let us go down, and there confound their language, that everyone perceive not another's speech. 

###### 8 
So the Lord scattered them from thence upon all the earth, and they left off to build the city. 

###### 9 
Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because the Lord did there confound the language of all the earth: from thence then did the Lord scatter them upon all the earth. 

###### 10 
¶ These are the generations of Shem: Shem _was_ an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood. 

###### 11 
And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 12 
Also Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah. 

###### 13 
And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah, four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 14 
And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber. 

###### 15 
So Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 16 
Likewise Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg. 

###### 17 
So Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 18 
And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu. 

###### 19 
And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 20 
Also Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug. 

###### 21 
So Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 22 
Moreover Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor. 

###### 23 
And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 24 
And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah. 

###### 25 
So Nahor lived after he begat Terah, an hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. 

###### 26 
So Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 

###### 27 
¶ Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran: and Haran begat Lot. 

###### 28 
Then Haran died before Terah his father in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 

###### 29 
So Abram and Nahor took them wives. The name of Abram's wife _was_ Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah. 

###### 30 
But Sarai was barren, _and_ had no child. 

###### 31 
Then Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife: and they departed together from Ur of the Chaldeans, to go into the land of Canaan, and they came to Haran, and dwelt there. 

###### 32 
So the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.
