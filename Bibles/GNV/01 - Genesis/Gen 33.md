###### 1 
And as Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, behold, Esau came, and with him four hundred men: and he divided the children to Leah, and unto Rachel, and to the two maids. 

###### 2 
And he put the maids, and their children foremost, and Leah, and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost. 

###### 3 
So he went before them and bowed himself to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother. 

###### 4 
And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his neck, and kissed him, and they wept. 

###### 5 
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women, and the children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he answered, _They are_ the children whom God of his grace hath given thy servant. 

###### 6 
Then came the maids near, they and their children, and bowed themselves. 

###### 7 
Leah also with her children came near and made obeisance: and after Joseph and Rachel drew near, and did reverence. 

###### 8 
Then he said, What meanest thou by all this drove, which I met? Who answered, I _have sent it_, that I may find favor in the sight of my lord. 

###### 9 
And Esau said, I have enough, my brother: keep that thou hast to thyself. 

###### 10 
But Jacob answered, Nay, I pray thee, if I have found grace now in thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for I have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, because thou hast accepted me. 

###### 11 
I pray thee take my blessing, that is brought thee: for God hath had mercy on me, and therefore I have all things: for he compelled him, and he took it. 

###### 12 
And he said, Let us take our journey and go, and I will go before thee. 

###### 13 
Then he answered him, My lord knoweth, that the children _are_ tender, and the ewes and kine with young under mine hand: and if they should overdrive them one day, all the flock would die. 

###### 14 
Let now my lord go before his servant, and I will drive softly, according to the pace of the cattle, which is before me, and as the children be able to endure, until I come to my lord unto Seir. 

###### 15 
Then Esau said, I will leave then some of my folk with thee. And he answered, What _needeth_ this? let me find grace in the sight of my lord. 

###### 16 
¶ So Esau returned, _and went_ his way that same day unto Seir. 

###### 17 
And Jacob went forward toward Succoth, and built him an house, and made booths for his cattle: therefore he called the name of the place Succoth. 

###### 18 
Afterward, Jacob came safe to Shechem a city, which is in the land of Canaan, when he came from Padan Aram, and pitched before the city. 

###### 19 
And there he bought a parcel of ground, where he pitched his tent, at the hand of the sons of Hamor Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money. 

###### 20 
And he set up there an altar, and called it, The mighty God of Israel.
