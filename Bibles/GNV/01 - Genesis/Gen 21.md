###### 1 
Now the Lord visited Sarah, as he had said, and did unto her according as he had promised. 

###### 2 
For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the same season that God told him. 

###### 3 
And Abraham called his son's name that was born unto him, which Sarah bare him, Isaac. 

###### 4 
Then Abraham circumcised Isaac his son, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. 

###### 5 
So Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was born unto him. 

###### 6 
¶ Then Sarah said, God hath made me to rejoice: all that hear, will rejoice with me. 

###### 7 
Again she said, Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah should have given children suck? for I have borne him a son in his old age. 

###### 8 
Then the child grew and was weaned: and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned. 

###### 9 
¶ And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian (which she had borne unto Abraham) mocking. 

###### 10 
Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son Isaac. 

###### 11 
And this thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight, because of his son. 

###### 12 
¶ But God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight for the child, and for thy bondwoman: in all that Sarah shall say unto thee, hear her voice: for in Isaac shall thy seed be called. 

###### 13 
As for the son of the bondwoman, I will make him a nation also, because he is thy seed. 

###### 14 
So Abraham arose up early in the morning and took bread, and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder, and the child _also_, and sent her away: who departing, wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba. 

###### 15 
And when the water of the bottle was spent, she cast the child under a certain tree. 

###### 16 
Then she went and sat her over against _him_ afar off about a bow shoot: for she said, I will not see the death of the child. And she sat down over against _him_, and lift up her voice, and wept. 

###### 17 
Then God heard the voice of the child, and the Angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, and said unto her, What aileth thee, Hagar? fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the child where he is. 

###### 18 
Arise, take up the child, and hold him in thine hand: for I will make him a great people. 

###### 19 
And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water: so she went and filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink. 

###### 20 
So God was with the child, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and was an archer. 

###### 21 
And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt. 

###### 22 
¶ And at the same time Abimelech and Phichol his chief captain spake unto Abraham, saying, God _is_ with thee in all that thou doest. 

###### 23 
Now therefore swear unto me here by God, that thou wilt not hurt me, nor my children, nor my children's children: thou shalt deal with me, and with the country, where thou hast been a stranger, according unto the kindness that I have showed thee. 

###### 24 
Then Abraham said, I will swear. 

###### 25 
And Abraham rebuked Abimelech for a well of water, which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away. 

###### 26 
And Abimelech said, I know not who hath done this thing: also thou toldest me not, neither heard I _of it_ but this day. 

###### 27 
Then Abraham took sheep and beeves, and gave them unto Abimelech: and they two made a covenant. 

###### 28 
And Abraham set seven lambs of the flock by themselves. 

###### 29 
Then Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven lambs, which thou hast set by themselves? 

###### 30 
And he answered, Because thou shalt receive of mine hand _these_ seven lambs, that it may be a witness unto me, that I have dug this well. 

###### 31 
Wherefore the place is called Beersheba, because there they both swear. 

###### 32 
Thus made they a covenant at Beersheba: afterward Abimelech and Phichol the chief captain rose up, and turned again unto the land of the Philistines. 

###### 33 
¶ And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on the Name of the Lord, the everlasting God. 

###### 34 
And Abraham was a stranger in the Philistine's land a long season.
