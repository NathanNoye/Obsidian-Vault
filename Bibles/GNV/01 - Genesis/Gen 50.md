###### 1 
Then Joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him, and kissed him. 

###### 2 
And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father, and the physicians embalmed Israel. 

###### 3 
So forty days were accomplished (for so long did the days of them that were embalmed last) and the Egyptians bewailed him seventy days. 

###### 4 
And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake to the house of Pharaoh, saying, If I have now found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears, of Pharaoh, and say, 

###### 5 
My father made me swear saying, Lo, I die, bury me in my grave, which I have made me in the land of Canaan: now therefore let me go, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again. 

###### 6 
Then Pharaoh said, Go up and bury thy father, as he made thee to swear. 

###### 7 
¶ So Joseph went up to bury his father, and with him went all the servants of Pharaoh, _both_ the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt, 

###### 8 
Likewise all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their children, and their sheep, and their cattle left they in the land of Goshen. 

###### 9 
And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and they were an exceeding great company. 

###### 10 
And they came to Goren Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they made a great and exceeding sore lamentation: and he mourned for his father seven days. 

###### 11 
And when the Canaanites the inhabitants of the land saw the mourning in Goren Atad, they said, This is a great mourning unto the Egyptians: wherefore the name thereof was called Abel Mizraim, which is beyond Jordan. 

###### 12 
So his sons did unto him, according as he had commanded them: 

###### 13 
For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which _cave _Abraham bought with the field, to be a place to bury in, of Ephron the Hittite beside Mamre. 

###### 14 
¶ Then Joseph returned into Egypt, he and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after that he had buried his father. 

###### 15 
And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will pay us again all the evil which we did unto him. 

###### 16 
Therefore they sent unto Joseph, saying, Thy father commanded before his death, saying, 

###### 17 
Thus shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive now, I pray thee, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin: for they rewarded thee evil. And now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of thy father's God. And Joseph wept, when they spake unto him. 

###### 18 
Also his brethren came unto him, and fell down before his face, and said, Behold, we be thy servants. 

###### 19 
To whom Joseph said, Fear not: for am not I under God? 

###### 20 
When ye thought evil against me, God disposed it to good, that he might bring to pass, as it is this day, and save much people alive. 

###### 21 
Fear not now therefore, I will nourish you, and your children: and he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them. 

###### 22 
¶ So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years. 

###### 23 
And Joseph saw Ephraim's children, even unto the third generation: also the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought upon Joseph's knees. 

###### 24 
And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am ready to die, and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land, unto the land which he sware unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob. 

###### 25 
And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry my bones hence. 

###### 26 
So Joseph died, when he was an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and put him in a chest in Egypt.
