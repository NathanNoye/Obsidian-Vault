###### 1 
Afterward Abraham departed thence toward the South country and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar. 

###### 2 
And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister. Then Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah. 

###### 3 
But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to him, Behold, thou art but dead, because of the woman, which thou hast taken: for she is a man's wife. 

###### 4 
(Notwithstanding Abimelech had not yet come near her) And he said, Lord, wilt thou slay even the righteous nation? 

###### 5 
Said not he unto me, She is my sister? yea, and she herself said, He is my brother: with an upright mind, and innocent hands have I done this. 

###### 6 
And God said unto him by a dream, I know that thou diddest this even with an upright mind, and I kept thee also that thou shouldest not sin against me: therefore suffered I thee not to touch her. 

###### 7 
Now then deliver the man his wife again: for he is a Prophet, and he shall pray for thee, that thou mayest live: but if thou deliver her not again, be sure that thou shalt die the death, thou, and all that thou hast. 

###### 8 
Then Abimelech rising up early in the morning, called all his servants, and told all these things unto them, and the men were sore afraid. 

###### 9 
Afterward Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou hast brought on me, and on my kingdom _this_ great sin? thou hast done things unto me that ought not to be done. 

###### 10 
So Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou that thou hast done this thing? 

###### 11 
Then Abraham answered, Because I thought _thus_, Surely the fear of God _is_ not in this place, and they will slay me for my wife's sake. 

###### 12 
Yet in very deed she is my sister: for she is the daughter of my father, but not the daughter of my mother, and she is my wife. 

###### 13 
Now when God caused me to wander out of my father's house, I said then to her, This is thy kindness that thou shalt show unto me in all places where we come, Say thou of me, He is my brother. 

###### 14 
Then took Abimelech sheep and beeves, and men servants, and women servants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him Sarah his wife. 

###### 15 
And Abimelech said, Behold, my land _is_ before thee, dwell where it pleaseth thee. 

###### 16 
Likewise to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is the veil of thine eyes to all that are with thee, and to all _others_: and she was thus reproved. 

###### 17 
¶ Then Abraham prayed unto God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife, and his women servants: and they bare children. 

###### 18 
For the Lord had shut up every womb of the house of Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.
