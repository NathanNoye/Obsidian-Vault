###### 1 
Then Jacob called his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall come to you in the last days. 

###### 2 
Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob, and hearken unto Israel your father. 

###### 3 
¶ Reuben mine eldest son, thou art my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 

###### 4 
_Thou wast_ light as water: thou shalt not be excellent, because thou wentest up to thy father's bed: then diddest thou defile my bed, _thy dignity_ is gone. 

###### 5 
¶ Simeon and Levi, brethren _in evil_, the instruments of cruelty _are_ in their habitations. 

###### 6 
Into their secret let not my soul come: my glory be not thou joined with their assembly: for in their wrath they slew a man, and in their self-will they dug down a wall. 

###### 7 
Cursed be their wrath, for it was fierce, and their rage, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel. 

###### 8 
¶ Thou Judah, thy brethren shall praise thee: thy hand _shall be_ in the neck of thine enemies: thy father's son shall bow down before unto thee. 

###### 9 
Judah _as_ a Lion's whelp shalt thou come up from the spoil, my son. He shall lie down _and_ couch a Lion, and as a Lioness: Who shall stir him up? 

###### 10 
The Sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a Lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come, and the people _shall be_ gathered unto him. 

###### 11 
He shall bind his Ass foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the best vine. He shall wash his garment in wine, and his cloak in the blood of grapes. 

###### 12 
His eyes _shall be_ red with wine, and his teeth white with milk. 

###### 13 
¶ Zebulun shall dwell by the seaside, and he _shall be_ an haven for ships: and his border _shall be_ unto Sidon. 

###### 14 
¶ Issachar _shall be_ a strong ass, couching down between two burdens: 

###### 15 
And he shall see that rest is good, and that the land is pleasant, and he shall bow his shoulder to bear, and shall be subject unto tribute. 

###### 16 
¶ Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel. 

###### 17 
Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder by the path, biting the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward. 

###### 18 
O Lord, I have waited for thy salvation. 

###### 19 
¶ Gad, a host of men shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last. 

###### 20 
¶ Concerning Asher, his bread _shall be_ fat, and he shall give pleasures for a king. 

###### 21 
¶ Naphtali _shall be_ a hind let go, giving goodly words. 

###### 22 
¶ Joseph _shall be_ a fruitful bough, _even_ a fruitful bough by the well side: the small boughs shall turn upon the wall: 

###### 23 
And the archers grieved him, and shot _against him_, and hated him. 

###### 24 
But his bow abode strong, and the hands of his arms were strengthened, by the hands of the mighty _God_ of Jacob, of whom _was_ the feeder _appointed_ by the stone of Israel, 

###### 25 
_Even_ by the God of thy father, who shall help thee, and by the almighty, who shall bless thee with heavenly blessings from above, with blessings of the deep that lieth beneath, with blessings of the breasts, and of the womb. 

###### 26 
The blessings of thy father shall be stronger than the blessings of mine elders: unto the end of the hills of the world they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the top of the head of him that was separated from his brethren. 

###### 27 
¶ Benjamin shall raven _as_ a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil. 

###### 28 
¶ All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and thus their father spake unto them, and blessed them: every one of them blessed he with a several blessing. 

###### 29 
And he charged them and said unto them, I am ready to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave, that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 

###### 30 
In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, besides Mamre in the land of Canaan: which _cave_ Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession to bury in. 

###### 31 
There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife: there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife: and there I buried Leah. 

###### 32 
The purchase of the field and the cave that is therein, _was bought_ of the children of Heth. 

###### 33 
Thus Jacob made an end of giving charge to his sons, and plucked his feet into the bed, and gave up the ghost, and was gathered to his people.
