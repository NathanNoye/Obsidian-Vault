###### 1 
Afterward Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses, because of the woman of Ethiopia whom he had married (for he had married a woman of Ethiopia.) 

###### 2 
And they said, What? hath the Lord spoken but only by Moses? hath he not spoken also by us? and the Lord heard _this_. 

###### 3 
(But Moses _was_ a very meek man above all the men that were upon the earth.) 

###### 4 
And by and by the Lord said unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, come out ye three unto the Tabernacle of the Congregation: and they three came forth. 

###### 5 
Then the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the Tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam, and they both came forth. 

###### 6 
And he said, Hear now my words, If there be a Prophet of the Lord among you, I will be known to him by a vision, _and_ will speak unto him by dream. 

###### 7 
My servant Moses _is_ not so, who is faithful in all mine house, 

###### 8 
Unto him will I speak mouth to mouth, and by vision, and not in dark words, but he shall see the similitude of the Lord. Wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant, _even_ against Moses? 

###### 9 
Thus the Lord was very angry with them, and departed. 

###### 10 
Also the cloud departed from the Tabernacle: and behold, Miriam _was_ leprous like snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, _she was_ leprous. 

###### 11 
Then Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, which we have foolishly committed, and wherein we have sinned. 

###### 12 
Let her not, I pray thee, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed, when he cometh out of his mother's womb. 

###### 13 
Then Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, O God, I beseech thee, heal her now. 

###### 14 
¶ And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had spit in her face, should she not have been ashamed seven days? let her be shut out of the host seven days, and after she shall be received. 

###### 15 
So Miriam was shut out of the host seven days, and the people removed not, till Miriam was brought in again.
