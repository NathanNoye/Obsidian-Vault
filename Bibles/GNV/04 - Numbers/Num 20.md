###### 1 
Then the children of Israel came with the whole Congregation to the desert of Zin in the first month, and the people abode at Kadesh: where Miriam died, and was buried there. 

###### 2 
But there was no water for the Congregation, and they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron. 

###### 3 
And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God we had perished when our brethren died before the Lord. 

###### 4 
Why have ye thus brought the Congregation of the Lord unto this wilderness, that _both_ we and our cattle should die there? 

###### 5 
Wherefore now have ye made us to come up from Egypt, to bring us into this miserable place, _which is_ no place of seed, nor figs, nor vines, nor pomegranates? neither is there any water to drink. 

###### 6 
Then Moses and Aaron went from the assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle of the Congregation, and fell upon their faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them. 

###### 7 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 8 
Take the rod, and gather thou and thy brother Aaron the Congregation together, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes, and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the Congregation and the beasts drink. 

###### 9 
Then Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he had commanded him. 

###### 10 
And Moses and Aaron gathered the Congregation together before the rock: and _Moses_ said unto them, Hear now ye rebels: shall we bring you water out of this rock? 

###### 11 
Then Moses lift up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice, and the water came out abundantly: so the Congregation, and their beasts drank. 

###### 12 
¶ Again, the Lord spake unto Moses, and to Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the presence of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this Congregation into the land which I have given them. 

###### 13 
This is the water of Meribah, because the children of Israel strove with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them. 

###### 14 
¶ Then Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, _saying_, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that we have had, 

###### 15 
How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we dwelt in Egypt a long time, where the Egyptians handled us evil and our fathers. 

###### 16 
But when we cried unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and sent an Angel, and hath brought us out of Egypt, and behold, we are in the city Kadesh, in thine utmost border. 

###### 17 
I pray thee that we may pass through thy country: we will not go through the fields nor the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's way, and neither turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we be past thy borders. 

###### 18 
And Edom answered him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. 

###### 19 
Then the children of Israel said unto him, We will go up by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, I will then pay for it: I will only (without any harm) go through on my feet. 

###### 20 
He answered again, Thou shalt not go through. Then Edom came out against him with much people, and with a mighty power. 

###### 21 
Thus Edom denied to give Israel passage through his country: wherefore Israel turned away from him. 

###### 22 
¶ And when the children of Israel with all the Congregation departed from Kadesh, they came unto mount Hor. 

###### 23 
And the Lord spake unto Moses and to Aaron in the mount Hor near the coast of the land of Edom, saying, 

###### 24 
Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land, which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye disobeyed my commandment at the water of Meribah. 

###### 25 
Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up into the mount Hor, 

###### 26 
And cause Aaron to put off his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: for Aaron shall be gathered _to his fathers_, and shall die there. 

###### 27 
And Moses did as the Lord had commanded: and they went up into the mount Hor, in the sight of all the Congregation. 

###### 28 
And Moses put off Aaron's clothes, and put them upon Eleazar his son: so Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from off the mount. 

###### 29 
When all the Congregation saw that Aaron was dead, all the house of Israel wept for Aaron thirty days.
