###### 1 
When Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, then he went not, as certain times before, to set divinations, but set his face toward the wilderness. 

###### 2 
And Balaam lift up his eyes, and looked upon Israel, which dwelt according to their tribes, and the Spirit of God came upon him, 

###### 3 
And he uttered his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes were shut up, hath said, 

###### 4 
He hath said which heard the words of God, and saw the vision of the Almighty, and falling _in a trance_ had his eyes opened: 

###### 5 
¶ How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, _and_ thine habitations, O Israel! 

###### 6 
As the valleys are they stretched forth, as gardens by the river's side, as the aloe trees, which the Lord hath planted, as the cedars beside the waters. 

###### 7 
The water droppeth out of his bucket, and his seed _shall be_ in many waters, and his King shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom shall be exalted. 

###### 8 
God brought him out of Egypt: his strength _shall be_ as an unicorn: he shall eat the nations his enemies, and bruise their bones, and shoot them through with his arrows. 

###### 9 
He coucheth, _and_ lieth down as a young Lion, and as a Lion: Who shall stir him up? blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that curseth thee. 

###### 10 
Then Balak was very angry with Balaam, and smote his hands together: so Balak said unto Balaam, I sent for thee to curse mine enemies, and behold, thou hast blessed them now three times. 

###### 11 
Therefore now flee unto thy place: I thought surely to promote thee unto honor, but lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honor. 

###### 12 
Then Balaam answered Balak, Told I not also thy messengers, which thou sentest unto me, saying, 

###### 13 
If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot pass the commandment of the Lord, to do _either_ good or bad of mine own mind? what the Lord shall command, that same will I speak. 

###### 14 
And now behold, I go unto my people: come, I will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy folk in the latter days. 

###### 15 
And he uttered his parable, and said Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes were shut up hath said, 

###### 16 
He hath said that heard the words of God, and hath the knowledge of the most High, and saw the vision of the Almighty, and falling _in a trance_ had his eyes opened: 

###### 17 
I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise of Israel and shall smite the coasts of Moab, and destroy all the sons of Sheth. 

###### 18 
And Edom shall be possessed, and Seir shall be a possession to their enemies: but Israel shall do valiantly. 

###### 19 
He also that shall have dominion _shall be_ of Jacob, and shall destroy the remnant of the city. 

###### 20 
¶ And when he looked on Amalek, he uttered his parable, and said, Amalek _was_ the first of the nations: but his latter end _shall come_ to destruction. 

###### 21 
And he looked on the Kenites, and uttered his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling place, and put thy nest in the rock: 

###### 22 
Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be spoiled, until Asshur carry thee away captive. 

###### 23 
Again he uttered his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when God doeth this? 

###### 24 
The ships also shall _come_ from the coasts of Kittim, and subdue Asshur, and shall subdue Eber, and he also _shall come_ to destruction. 

###### 25 
Then Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.
