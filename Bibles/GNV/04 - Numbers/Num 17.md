###### 1 
And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

###### 2 
Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod, after the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the family of their fathers, _even_ twelve rods: _and_ thou shalt write every man's name upon his rod. 

###### 3 
And write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for every rod _shall be_ for the head of the house of their fathers. 

###### 4 
And thou shalt put them in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, before _the Ark_ of the testimony, where I will declare myself to you. 

###### 5 
And the man's rod, whom I choose, shall blossom: and I will make cease from me the grudgings of the children of Israel, which grudge against you. 

###### 6 
¶ Then Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and all their Princes gave him a rod, one rod for every prince, according to the houses of their fathers, _even_ twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 

###### 7 
And Moses laid the rods before the Lord in the Tabernacle of the Testimony. 

###### 8 
And when Moses on the morrow went into the Tabernacle of the Testimony, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and brought forth blossoms, and bare ripe almonds. 

###### 9 
Then Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the children of Israel: and they looked upon them, and took every man his rod. 

###### 10 
After, the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the Testimony to be kept for a token to the rebellious children, and thou shalt cause their murmurings to cease from me, that they die not. 

###### 11 
So Moses did as the Lord had commanded him: so did he. 

###### 12 
¶ And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we are dead, we perish, we are all lost: 

###### 13 
Whosoever cometh near or approacheth to the Tabernacle of the Lord, shall die: shall we be consumed and die?
