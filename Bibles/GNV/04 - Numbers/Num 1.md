###### 1 
The Lord spake again unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tabernacle of the Congregation, in the first _day_ of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 

###### 2 
Take ye the sum of all the Congregation of the children of Israel, after their families _and_ households of their fathers, with the number of their names: _to wit_, all the males, man by man: 

###### 3 
From twenty years old and above, all that go forth to the war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them throughout their armies. 

###### 4 
And with you shall be men of every tribe, such _as are_ the heads of the house of their fathers. 

###### 5

###### 18 
And they called all the Congregation together in the first _day _of the second month, who declared their kindred by their families, _and_ by the houses of their fathers according to the number of _their_ names, from twenty years old and above, man by man. 

###### 19

###### 34

###### 36 
Of the sons of Benjamin by their generations, by their families, _and_ by the houses of their fathers, according to the number of _their_ names, from twenty years old and above, all that went forth to war: 

###### 37 
The number of them _also_ of the tribe of Benjamin _was_ five and thirty thousand and four hundred. 

###### 38 
Of the sons of Dan by their generations, by their families, _and_ by the houses of their fathers, according to the number of _their_ names, from twenty years old and above, all that went forth to war:

###### 44 
These are the sums which Moses, and Aaron numbered, and the Princes of Israel, the twelve men _which_ were every one for the house of their fathers. 

###### 45 
So _this_ was all the sum of the sons of Israel, by the houses of their fathers, from twenty years old and above, all that went to the war in Israel. 

###### 46 
And all they were in number six hundred and three thousand five hundred and fifty. 

###### 47 
But the Levites, after the tribes of their fathers were not numbered among them. 

###### 48 
For the Lord had spoken unto Moses, and said, 

###### 49 
Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel. 

###### 50 
But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony, and over all the instruments thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the Tabernacle, and all the instruments thereof, and shall minister in it, and shall dwell round about the Tabernacle. 

###### 51 
And when the Tabernacle goeth forth, the Levites shall take it down: and when the Tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: for the stranger that cometh near, shall be slain. 

###### 52 
Also the children of Israel shall pitch their tents every man in his camp, and every man under his standard throughout their armies. 

###### 53 
But the Levites shall pitch round about the Tabernacle of the Testimony, lest vengeance come upon the Congregation of the children of Israel, and the Levites shall take the charge of the Tabernacle of the Testimony. 

###### 54 
So the children of Israel did according to all that the Lord had commanded Moses: so did they.
