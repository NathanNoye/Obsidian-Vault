###### 1 
Now there was a great cry of the people, and of their wives against their brethren the Jews. 

###### 2 
For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters are many, therefore we take up corn, that we may eat and live. 

###### 3 
And there were that said, We must gage our lands, and our vineyards, and our houses, and take up corn for the famine. 

###### 4 
There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute _upon_ our lands and our vineyards. 

###### 5 
And now our flesh _is_ as the flesh of our brethren, _and_ our sons as their sons: and lo, we bring into subjection our sons and our daughters, as servants, and there be of our daughters _now_ in subjection, and there _is_ no power in our hands: for other men _have_ our lands and our vineyards. 

###### 6 
Then was I very angry when I heard their cry and these words. 

###### 7 
And I thought in my mind, and I rebuked the princes, and the rulers, and said unto them, You lay burdens every one upon his brethren: and I set a great assembly against them, 

###### 8 
And I said unto them, We (according to our ability) have redeemed our brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen: and will you sell your brethren again, or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and could not answer. 

###### 9 
I said also, That which ye do, is not good. Ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, for the reproach of the heathen our enemies? 

###### 10 
For even I, my brethren, and my servants do lend them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this burden. 

###### 11 
Restore, I pray you, unto them this day their lands, their vineyards, their olives, and their houses, and _remit_ the hundredth part of the silver and of the corn, of the wine, and of the oil that ye exact of them. 

###### 12 
Then said they, We will restore it, and will not require it of them: we will do as thou hast said. Then I called the Priests and caused them to swear, that they should do according to this promise. 

###### 13 
So I shook my lap, and said, So let God shake out every man that will not perform this promise, from his house, and from his labor: even thus let him be shaken out and emptied. And all the Congregation said, Amen, and praised the Lord: and the people did according to this promise. 

###### 14 
And from the time that _the King_ gave me charge to be governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year, even unto the two and thirtieth year of King Artaxerxes, _that is_, twelve years, I, and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor. 

###### 15 
For the former governors that were before me, had been chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver: yea, and their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God. 

###### 16 
But rather I fortified _a portion_ in the work of this wall, and we bought no land, and all my servants came thither together unto the work. 

###### 17 
Moreover there _were_ at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews, and rulers, which came unto us from among the heathen that are about us. 

###### 18 
And there was prepared daily an ox, _and_ six chosen sheep, and birds were prepared for me, and within ten days wine for all in abundance. Yet for all this I required not the bread of the governor: for the bondage was grievous unto this people. 

###### 19 
Remember me, O my God, in goodness, _according_ to all that I have done for this people.
