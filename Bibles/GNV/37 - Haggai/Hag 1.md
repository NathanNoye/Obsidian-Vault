###### 1 
In the second year of king Darius, in the sixth month, the first day of the month, came the word of the Lord (by the ministry of the Prophet Haggai) unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, a prince of Judah, and to Jehoshua the son of Jehozadak the high Priest, saying, 

###### 2 
Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, This people say, the time is not yet come, that the Lord's house should be built. 

###### 3 
Then came the word of the Lord by the ministry of the Prophet Haggai, saying, 

###### 4 
Is it time for yourselves to dwell in your ceiled houses, and this house lie waste? 

###### 5 
Now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider your own ways in your hearts. 

###### 6 
Ye have sown much, and bring in little: ye eat, but ye have not enough: ye drink, but ye are not filled: ye clothe you, but ye be not warm: and he that earneth wages, putteth the wages into a broken bag. 

###### 7 
Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Consider your own ways in your hearts. 

###### 8 
Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build this House, and I will be favorable in it, and I will be glorified, saith the Lord. 

###### 9 
Ye looked for much, and lo, _it came_ to little: and when ye brought it home, I did blow upon it. And why, saith the Lord of hosts? Because of mine House that is waste, and ye turn every man unto his own house. 

###### 10 
Therefore the heaven over you stayed itself from dew, and the earth stayed her fruit. 

###### 11 
And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the wine, and upon the oil, upon _all_ that the ground bringeth forth: both upon men and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of the hands. 

###### 12 
When Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high Priest, with all the remnant of the people, heard the voice of the Lord their God, and the words of the Prophet Haggai (as the Lord their God had sent him) then the people did fear before the Lord. 

###### 13 
Then spake Haggai the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the Lord. 

###### 14 
And the Lord stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, a prince of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak the high Priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people, and they came, and did the work in the House of the Lord of hosts their God.
