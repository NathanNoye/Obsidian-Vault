###### 1 
And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb. 

###### 2 
In the midst of the street of it, and of either side of the river was the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and gave fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree _served_ to heal the nations with. 

###### 3 
And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him. 

###### 4 
And they shall see his face, and his Name shall be in their foreheads. 

###### 5 
And there shall be no night there, and they need no candle, neither light of the Sun: for the Lord God giveth them light, and they shall reign for evermore. 

###### 6 
And he said unto me, These words are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy Prophets sent his Angel to show unto his servants the things which must shortly be fulfilled. 

###### 7 
**Behold, I come shortly. **Blessed _is_ he that keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book. 

###### 8 
And I am John, which saw and heard these things: and when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the Angel which showed me these things. 

###### 9 
But he said unto me, See thou _do it_ not: for I am thy fellow servant, and of thy brethren the Prophets, and of them which keep the words of this book: worship God. 

###### 10 
And he said unto me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book: for the time is at hand. 

###### 11 
He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy still. 

###### 12 
**And behold, I come shortly, and my reward is with me, to give to every man according as his work shall be.

###### 13 
**I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last.** 

###### 14 
Blessed _are_ they, that do his Commandments, that their right may be in the tree of Life, and may enter in through the gates into the City. 

###### 15 
For without _shall be_ dogs and enchanters, and whoremongers, and murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth or maketh lies.

###### 17 
And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come: and let him that is athirst, come: and let whosoever will, take of the water of life freely. 

###### 18 
For I protest unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book. 

###### 19 
And if any man shall diminish of the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy City, and from those things which are written in this book. 

###### 20 
He which testifieth these things, saith, **Surely I come quickly, **Amen. Even so, come Lord Jesus. 

###### 21 
The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with you all, AMEN. THE END
