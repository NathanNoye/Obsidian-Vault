###### 1 
And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven Angels having the seven last plagues: for by them is fulfilled the wrath of God. 

###### 2 
And I saw as_ it were_ a glassy sea, mingled with fire, and them that had gotten victory of the beast, and of his image, and of his mark, and of the number of his name, stand at the glassy sea, having the harps of God, 

###### 3 
And they sung the song of Moses the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvelous _are_ thy works, Lord God Almighty: just and true _are_ thy ways, King of Saints. 

###### 4 
Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name! for thou only _art_ holy, and all nations shall come and worship before thee: for thy judgments are made manifest. 

###### 5 
And after that, I looked, and behold, the Temple of the tabernacle of Testimony was open in heaven. 

###### 6 
And the seven Angels came out of the Temple, which had the seven plagues, clothed in pure and bright linen, and having their breasts girded with golden girdles. 

###### 7 
And therefore four beasts gave unto the seven Angels seven golden vials full of the wrath of God which lived for evermore. 

###### 8 
And the temple was full of the smoke of the glory of God and of his power, and no man was able to enter into the Temple, till the seven plagues of the seven Angels were fulfilled.
