###### 1 
The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to show unto his servants things which must shortly be done: which he sent, and showed by his Angel unto his servant John, 

###### 2 
Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw. 

###### 3 
Blessed _is he_ that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. 

###### 4 
John to the seven Churches which are in Asia, Grace _be_ with you, and peace from him, Which is, and Which was, and Which is to come, and from the seven Spirits which are before his Throne, 

###### 5 
And from Jesus Christ which is that faithful witness, _and_ that first begotten of the dead, and that Prince of the Kings of the earth, unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his blood, 

###### 6 
And made us Kings and Priests unto God even his Father, to him, _I say, be_ glory, and dominion for evermore, Amen. 

###### 7 
Behold, he cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him: yea, even they which pierced him through: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail before him, Even so, Amen. 

###### 8 
**I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending**, saith the Lord, Which is, and Which was, and Which is to come, _even_ the Almighty. 

###### 9 
I John even your brother and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the Isle called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the witnessing of Jesus Christ. 

###### 10 
And I was _ravished_ in spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as it had been of a trumpet, 

###### 11 
Saying, **I am Alpha and Omega, that first and that last: and that which thou seest write in a book, and send it unto the seven Churches which are in Asia, unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.** 

###### 12 
Then I turned back to see the voice that spake with me: and when I was turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks, 

###### 13 
And in the midst of the seven candlesticks, one like unto the son of man, clothed with a garment down to the feet, and girded about the paps with a golden girdle. 

###### 14 
His head and hairs _were_ white as white wool, and as snow, and his eyes _were_ as a flame of fire, 

###### 15 
And his feet like unto fine brass burning as in a furnace: and his voice as the sound of many waters. 

###### 16 
And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword, and his face _shone_ as the sun shineth in his strength. 

###### 17 
And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead: then he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, **Fear not: I am that first and that last, The Bible (GNV) The Bible.md VBoxAudioTest VBoxAutostart VBoxBalloonCtrl VBoxBugReport VBoxHeadless VBoxManage VBoxVRDP VirtualBox VirtualBoxVM aws aws_completer bg2md.rb bg2obs.sh com.docker.cli contentful corepack docker docker-compose docker-compose-v1 docker-credential-desktop docker-credential-ecr-login docker-credential-osxkeychain firebase fuzzy_match httpclient hub-tool iloktool kubectl kubectl.docker locales n node npm npx pod sandbox-pod serverless sls tsc tsserver vbox-img vboximg-mount vpnkit xcodeproj
