###### 1 
And the fifth Angel blew the trumpet, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth, and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. 

###### 2 
And he opened the bottomless pit, and there arose the smoke of the pit, the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun, and the air were darkened by the smoke of the pit. 

###### 3 
And there came out of the smoke Locusts upon the earth, and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. 

###### 4 
And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree: but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. 

###### 5 
And to them was commanded that they should not kill them, but that they should be vexed five months, and that their pain should be as the pain that cometh of a scorpion, when he hath stung a man. 

###### 6 
Therefore in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it, and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. 

###### 7 
And the form of the locusts _was_ like unto horses prepared unto the battle, and on their heads _were _as_ it were_ crowns, like unto gold, and their faces _were_ like the faces of men. 

###### 8 
And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. 

###### 9 
And they had habergeons, like unto habergeons of iron, and the sound of their wings _was _like the sound of chariots when many horses run unto battle. 

###### 10 
And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails, and their power was to hurt men five months. 

###### 11 
And they have a king over them, which is the Angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew _is_ Abaddon, and in Greek he is named Apollyon_, that is, destroying_. 

###### 12 
One woe is past, _and_ behold, yet two woes come after this. 

###### 13 
¶ Then the sixth Angel blew the trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar, which is before God, 

###### 14 
Saying to the sixth Angel, which had the trumpet, Loose the four Angels, which are bound in the great river Euphrates. 

###### 15 
And the four Angels were loosed, which were prepared at an hour, at a day, at a month, and at a year to slay the third part of men. 

###### 16 
And the number of horsemen of war were twenty thousand times ten thousand: for I heard the number of them. 

###### 17 
And thus I saw the horses in a vision, and them that sat on them, having fiery habergeons, and of hyacinth, and of brimstone, and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions, and out of their mouths went forth fire, and smoke, and brimstone. 

###### 18 
Of these three was the third part of men killed, _that is_, of the fire, and of the smoke, and of the brimstone, which came out of their mouths. 

###### 19 
For their power is in their mouths, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads wherewith they hurt. 

###### 20 
And the remnant of the men which were not killed by these plagues, repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood, which neither can see, neither hear, nor go. 

###### 21 
Also they repented not of their murder, and of their sorcery, neither of their fornication, nor of their theft.
