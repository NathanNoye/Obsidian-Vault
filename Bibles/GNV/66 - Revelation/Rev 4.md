###### 1 
After this I looked, and behold, a door was open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard, was as it were of a trumpet talking with me, saying, Come up hither, and I will show thee things which must be done hereafter. 

###### 2 
And immediately I was _ravished_ in the spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat upon the throne. 

###### 3 
And he that sat, was to look upon, like unto a Jasper stone, and a sardine, and there _was_ a rainbow round about the throne, in sight like to an emerald. 

###### 4 
And round about the throne _were_ four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty Elders sitting, clothed in white raiment, and had on their heads crowns of gold. 

###### 5 
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings, and thunderings and voices, and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God. 

###### 6 
And before the throne there _was_ a Sea of glass like unto crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the throne _were_ four beasts, full of eyes before and behind. 

###### 7 
And the first beast _was_ like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast _was_ like a flying Eagle. 

###### 8 
And the four beasts had each one of them six wings about him, and they were full of eyes within, and they ceased not day nor night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Which was, and which is, and which is to come. 

###### 9 
And when those beasts gave glory, and honor, and thanks to him that sat on the throne, which liveth forever and ever, 

###### 10 
The four and twenty Elders fell down before him that sat on the throne, and worshipped him that liveth for evermore, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying, 

###### 11 
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory, and honor, and power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy will's sake they are, and have been created.
