###### 1 
How doth the city remain solitary that was full of people? she is as a widow: she that was great among the nations, _and_ princess among the provinces, is made tributary. 

###### 2 
She weepeth continually in the night, and her tears _run down_ by her cheeks: among all her lovers, she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt unfaithfully with her, _and_ are her enemies. 

###### 3 
Judah is carried away captive, because of affliction, and because of great servitude, she dwelleth among the heathen, _and_ findeth no rest: all her persecutors took her in the straits. 

###### 4 
The ways of Zion lament, because no man comethto the solemn feasts, all her gates are desolate: her Priests sigh: her virgins are discomfited, and she is in heaviness. 

###### 5 
Her adversaries are the chief, _and_ her enemies prosper: for the Lord hath afflicted her, for the multitude of her transgressions, _and_ her children are gone into captivity before the enemy. 

###### 6 
And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer. 

###### 7 
Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction, and of her rebellion, _and_ all her pleasant things that she had in times past, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her: the adversary saw her, _and_ did mock at her Sabbaths. 

###### 8 
Jerusalem hath grievously sinned, therefore she is in derision: all that honored her, despise her, because they have seen her filthiness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. 

###### 9 
Her filthiness is in her skirts: she remembered not her last end, therefore she came down wonderfully: she had no comforter: O Lord, behold mine affliction: for the enemy is proud. 

###### 10 
The enemy hath stretched out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen the heathen enter into her Sanctuary, whom thou didst command, that they should not enter into thy Church. 

###### 11 
All her people sigh and seek _their_ bread: they have given their pleasant things for meat to refresh the soul: see, O Lord, and consider: for I am become vile. 

###### 12 
Have ye no regard, all ye that pass by _this _way? behold and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me wherewith the Lord hath afflicted _me_ in the day of his fierce wrath. 

###### 13 
From above hath he sent fire into my bones, which prevail against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, _and_ turned me back: he hath made me desolate, _and_ daily in heaviness. 

###### 14 
The yoke of my transgressions is bound upon his hand: they are wrapped, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall: the Lord hath delivered me into _their_ hands, neither am I able to rise up. 

###### 15 
The Lord hath trodden under foot all my valiant men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to destroy my young men: the Lord hath trodden the winepress upon the virgin the daughter of Judah. 

###### 16 
For these things I weep: mine eye, _even_ mine eye casteth out water, because the comforter that should refresh my soul, is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. 

###### 17 
Zion stretcheth out her hands, and there _is_ none to comfort her: the Lord hath appointed the enemies of Jacob round about him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman in the midst of them. 

###### 18 
The Lord is righteous: for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. 

###### 19 
I called for my lovers, _but_ they deceived me: my Priests and mine Elders perished in the city, while they sought their meat to refresh their souls. 

###### 20 
Behold, O Lord, how I am troubled: my bowels swell: mine heart is turned within me, for I am full of heaviness: the sword spoileth abroad, as death _doeth_ at home. 

###### 21 
They have heard that I mourn, _but_ there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of my trouble, _and_ are glad, that thou hast done it: thou wilt bring the day, that thou hast pronounced, and they shall be like unto me. 

###### 22 
Let all their wickedness come before thee: do unto them, as thou hast done unto me, for all my transgressions: for my sighs are many, and mine heart is heavy.
