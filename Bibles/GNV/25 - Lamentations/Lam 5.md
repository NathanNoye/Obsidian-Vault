###### 1 
Remember, O Lord, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach. 

###### 2 
Our inheritance is turned to the strangers, our houses to the aliens. 

###### 3 
We are fatherless, even without father, _and_ our mothers are as widows. 

###### 4 
We have drunk our water for money, _and_ our wood is sold _unto us_. 

###### 5 
Our necks are under persecution: we are weary, and have no rest. 

###### 6 
We have given our hands to the Egyptians, _and_ to Assyria, to be satisfied with bread. 

###### 7 
Our fathers have sinned, and are not, and we have borne their iniquities. 

###### 8 
Servants have ruled over us, none would deliver us out of their hands. 

###### 9 
We got our bread with the _peril_ of our lives, because of the sword of the wilderness. 

###### 10 
Our skin was black like as an oven because of the terrible famine. 

###### 11 
They defiled the women in Zion, _and_ the maids in the cities of Judah. 

###### 12 
The princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of the Elders were not had in honor. 

###### 13 
They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood. 

###### 14 
The Elders have ceased from the gate _and_ the young men from their songs. 

###### 15 
The joy of our heart is gone, our dance is turned into mourning. 

###### 16 
The crown of our head is fallen: woe now unto us, that we have sinned. 

###### 17 
Therefore our heart is heavy for these things, our eyes are dim, 

###### 18 
Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate: the foxes run upon it. 

###### 19 
_But_ thou, O Lord, remainest forever: thy throne is from generation to generation. 

###### 20 
Wherefore dost thou forget us forever, _and_ forsake us so long time? 

###### 21 
Turn thou us unto thee, O Lord, and we shall be turned: renew our days as of old. 

###### 22 
But thou hast utterly rejected us: thou art exceedingly angry against us.
