###### 1 
How is the gold become so dim? the most fine gold is changed, _and_ the stones of the Sanctuary are scattered in the corner of every street. 

###### 2 
The noble men of Zion comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, _even_ the work of the hands of the potter! 

###### 3 
Even the dragons draw out the breasts, and give suck to their young: _but_ the daughter of my people _is become_ cruel like the ostriches in the wilderness. 

###### 4 
The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, _but_ no man breaketh it unto them. 

###### 5 
They that did feed delicately, perish in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet, embrace the dung. 

###### 6 
For the iniquity of the daughter of my people is become greater than the sin of Sodom, that was destroyed as in a moment, and none pitched camps against her. 

###### 7 
Her Nazirites were purer than the snow, _and_ whiter than the milk: they were more ruddy in body, than the red precious stones: they were _like_ polished sapphire. 

###### 8 
_Now_ their visage is blacker than a coal: they cannot know them in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones: it is withered like a stock. 

###### 9 
They that be slain with the sword, are better than they that are killed with hunger: for they fade away _as_ they were stricken through for the fruits of the field. 

###### 10 
The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children, _which_ were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 11 
The Lord hath accomplished his indignation: he hath poured out his fierce wrath, he hath kindled a fire in Zion, which hath devoured the foundations thereof. 

###### 12 
The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem: 

###### 13 
For the sins of her prophets, _and_ the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her. 

###### 14 
They have wandered _as_ blind menin the streets, and they were polluted with blood, so thatthey would not touch their garments. 

###### 15 
_But_ they cried unto them, Depart ye polluted, depart, depart, touch not: therefore they fled away, and wandered: they have said among the heathen, They shall no more dwell there. 

###### 16 
The anger of the Lord hath scattered them, he will no more regard them: they reverenced not the face of the Priest, nor had compassion on the Elders. 

###### 17 
While we waited for our vain help, our eyes failed: for in our waiting we looked for a nation that could not save us. 

###### 18 
They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled, for our end is come. 

###### 19 
Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, and laid wait for us in the wilderness. 

###### 20 
The breath of our nostrils, the Anointed of the Lord was taken in their nets, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall be preserved alive among the heathen. 

###### 21 
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter Edom: that dwellest in the land of Uz, the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken and vomit. 

###### 22 
Thy punishment is accomplished, O daughter Zion: he will no more carry thee away into captivity, _but_ he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter Edom, he will discover thy sins.
