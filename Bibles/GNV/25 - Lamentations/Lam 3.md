###### 1 
I am the man that hath seen affliction in the rod of his indignation. 

###### 2 
He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not to light. 

###### 3 
Surely he is turned against me: he turneth his hand _against me_ all the day. 

###### 4 
My flesh and my skin hath he caused to wax old, _and_ he hath broken my bones. 

###### 5 
He hath built against me, and compassed _me_ with gall and labor. 

###### 6 
He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead forever. 

###### 7 
He hath hedged about me, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chains heavy. 

###### 8 
Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer. 

###### 9 
He hath stopped up my ways with hewn stone, _and_ turned away my paths. 

###### 10 
He was unto me _as_ a bear lying in wait, _and as_ a lion in secret places. 

###### 11 
He hath stopped my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate. 

###### 12 
He hath bent his bow, and made me a mark for the arrow. 

###### 13 
He caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins. 

###### 14 
I was a derision to all my people, _and_ their song all the day. 

###### 15 
He hath filled me with bitterness, _and_ made me drunken with wormwood. 

###### 16 
He hath also broken my teeth with stones, _and_ hath covered me with ashes. 

###### 17 
Thus my soul was far off from peace: I forgot prosperity, 

###### 18 
And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the Lord, 

###### 19 
Remembering mine affliction, and my mourning, the wormwood and the gall. 

###### 20 
My soul hath them in remembrance, and is humbled in me. 

###### 21 
I consider this in mine heart: therefore have I hope. 

###### 22 
It is the Lord's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not. 

###### 23 
_They are_ renewed every morning: great is thy faithfulness. 

###### 24 
The Lord _is_ my portion, saith my soul: therefore will I hope in him. 

###### 25 
The Lord is good unto them that trust in him, _and_ to the soul that seeketh him. 

###### 26 
It is good both to trust, and to wait for the salvation of the Lord. 

###### 27 
It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. 

###### 28 
He sitteth alone, and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him. 

###### 29 
He putteth his mouth in the dust, if there may be hope. 

###### 30 
He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproaches. 

###### 31 
For the Lord will not forsake forever. 

###### 32 
But though he send affliction, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies. 

###### 33 
For he doth not punish willingly, nor afflict the children of men, 

###### 34 
In stamping under his feet all the prisoners of the earth, 

###### 35 
In overthrowing the right of a man before the face of the most High, 

###### 36 
In subverting a man in his cause: the Lord seeth it not. 

###### 37 
Who is he then that saith, and it cometh to pass, _and_ the Lord commandeth it not? 

###### 38 
Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good? 

###### 39 
Wherefore _then_ is the living man sorrowful? man _suffereth_ for his sin. 

###### 40 
Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the Lord. 

###### 41 
Let us lift up our hearts with our hands unto God in the heavens. 

###### 42 
We have sinned, and have rebelled, _therefore_ thou hast not spared. 

###### 43 
Thou hast covered _us_ with wrath, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, _and_ not spared. 

###### 44 
Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that _our_ prayer should not pass through. 

###### 45 
Thou hast made us _as_ the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people. 

###### 46 
All our enemies have opened their mouth against us. 

###### 47 
Fear, and a snare is come upon us _with_ desolation and destruction. 

###### 48 
Mine eye casteth out rivers of water, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. 

###### 49 
Mine eye droppeth without stay, and ceaseth not, 

###### 50 
Till the Lord look down, and behold from heaven. 

###### 51 
Mine eye breaketh mine heart because of all the daughters of my city. 

###### 52 
Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause. 

###### 53 
They have shut up my lifein the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me. 

###### 54 
Waters flowed over mine head, _then_ thought I, I am destroyed. 

###### 55 
I called upon thy Name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. 

###### 56 
Thou hast heard my voice: stop not thine ear from my sigh, _and_ from my cry. 

###### 57 
Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidest, Fear not. 

###### 58 
O Lord, thou hast maintained the cause of my soul, _and_ hast redeemed my life. 

###### 59 
O Lord, thou hast seen my wrong, judge thou my cause. 

###### 60 
Thou hast seen all their vengeance, _and_ all their devises against me: 

###### 61 
Thou hast heard their reproach, O Lord, _and_ all their imaginations against me. 

###### 62 
The lips _also_ of those that rose against me, and their whispering against me continually. 

###### 63 
Behold, their sitting down, and their rising up, _how_ I am their song. 

###### 64 
Give them a recompense, O Lord, according to the work of their hands. 

###### 65 
Give them sorrow of heart _even_ thy curse to them. 

###### 66 
Persecute with wrath and destroy them from under the heaven, O Lord.
