###### 1 
The burden of the word of the Lord upon Israel, saith the Lord, which spread the heavens, and laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man within him. 

###### 2 
Behold, I will make Jerusalem acup of poison unto all the people round about: and also with Judah will he be in the siege against Jerusalem. 

###### 3 
And in that day will I make Jerusalem an heavy stone for all people: all that lift it up, shall be torn, though all the people of the earth be gathered together against it. 

###### 4 
In that day, saith the Lord, I will smite every horse with astonishment, and his rider with madness, and I will open mine eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the people with blindness. 

###### 5 
And the princes of Judah shall say in their hearts, The inhabitants of Jerusalem _shall be_ my strength in the Lord of hosts their God. 

###### 6 
In that day will I make the princes of Judah like coals of fire among the wood, and like a firebrand in the sheaf, and they shall devour all the people round about on the right hand, and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place, _even_ in Jerusalem. 

###### 7 
The Lord also shall preserve the tents of Judah, _as_ afore time: therefore the glory of the house of David shall not boast, nor the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem against Judah. 

###### 8 
In that day shall the Lord defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and he that is feeble among them, in that day shall be as David: and the house of David _shall be_ as God's _house, and_ as the Angel of the Lord before them. 

###### 9 
And in that day will I seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 

###### 10 
And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Spirit of grace and of compassion, and they shall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they shall lament for him, as one mourneth for _his_ only _son_, and be sorry for him as one is sorry for _his _firstborn. 

###### 11 
In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the mourning of Hadad Rimmon in the valley of Megiddo. 

###### 12 
And the land shall bewail every family apart, the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart: the family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart: 

###### 13 
The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart: the family of Shemei apart, and their wives apart: 

###### 14 
All the families that remain, every family apart, and their wives apart.
