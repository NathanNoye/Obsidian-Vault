###### 1 
And he showed me Joshua the high Priest, standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan stood at his right hand to resist him. 

###### 2 
And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord reprove thee, O Satan: even the Lord that hath chosen Jerusalem, reprove thee. Is not this a n taken out of the fire? 

###### 3 
Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the Angel. 

###### 4 
And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to depart from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment. 

###### 5 
And I said, Let them set a fair diadem upon his head. So they set a fair diadem upon his head, and clothed him with garments, and the Angel of the Lord stood by. 

###### 6 
And the Angel of the Lord testified unto Joshua, saying, 

###### 7 
Thus saith the Lord of hosts, If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my watch, thou shalt also judge mine house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee place among these that stand by. 

###### 8 
Hear now, O Joshua the high Priest, thou and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are monstrous persons: but behold, I will bring forth the Branch my servant. 

###### 9 
For lo, the stone that I have laid before Joshua: upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will cut out the graving thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will take away the iniquity of this land in one day. 

###### 10 
In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbor under the vine, and under the fig tree.
