###### 1 
I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand. 

###### 2 
Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, that I may see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof. 

###### 3 
And behold, the Angel that talked with me, went forth, and another Angel went out to meet him, 

###### 4 
And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, and say, Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls, for the multitude of men and cattle therein. 

###### 5 
For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her. 

###### 6 
Ho, ho, _come __forth_, and flee from the land of the North, saith the Lord: for I have scattered you into the four winds of the heaven, saith the Lord. 

###### 7 
Save thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babel. 

###### 8 
For thus saith the Lord of hosts, After _this_ glory hath he sent me unto the nations, which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you, toucheth the apple of his eye. 

###### 9 
For behold, I will lift up mine hand upon them: and they shall be a spoil to those that served them, and ye shall know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me. 

###### 10 
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter Zion: for lo, I come, and will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. 

###### 11 
And many nations shall be joined to the Lord in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto thee. 

###### 12 
And the Lord shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again. 

###### 13 
Let all flesh be still before the Lord: for he is raised up out of his holy place.
