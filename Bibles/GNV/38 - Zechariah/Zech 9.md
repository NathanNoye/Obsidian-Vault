###### 1 
The burden of the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach: and Damascus _shall be_ his rest: when the eyes of man, _even_ of all the tribes of Israel _shall be_ toward the Lord. 

###### 2 
And Hamath also shall border thereby: Tyre _also_ and Sidon, though _they be_ very wise. 

###### 3 
For Tyre did build herself a stronghold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and gold as the mire of the streets. 

###### 4 
Behold, the Lord will spoil her, and he will smite her power in the sea, and she shall be devoured with fire. 

###### 5 
Ashkelon shall see it, and fear, and Gaza also shall be very sorrowful, and Ekron: for her countenance shall be ashamed, and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited. 

###### 6 
And the stranger shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines. 

###### 7 
And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he shall be for our God, and he shall be as a prince in Judah, but Ekron _shall be_ as a Jebusite. 

###### 8 
And I will camp about mine House against the army, against him that passeth by, and against him that returneth, and no oppressor shall come upon them anymore: for now have I seen with mine eyes. 

###### 9 
Rejoice greatly, O daughter Zion: shout for joy, O daughter Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee: he is just, and saved himself, poor and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. 

###### 10 
And I will cut off the chariots from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem: the bow of the battle shall be broken, and he shall speak peace unto the heathen, and his dominion _shall be _from sea unto sea, and from the River to the end of the land. 

###### 11 
Thou also _shall be saved_ through the blood of thy covenant. I have loosed thy prisoners out of the pit wherein _is_ no water. 

###### 12 
Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope: even today do I declare, that I will render the double unto thee. 

###### 13 
For Judah have I bent as a bow for me: Ephraim's hand have I filled, and I have raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and have made thee as a giant's sword. 

###### 14 
And the Lord shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord God shall blow the trumpet, and shall come forth with the whirlwinds of the South. 

###### 15 
The Lord of hosts shall defend them, and they shall devour them, and subdue them with sling stones, and they shall drink, _and_ make a noise as through wine, and they shall be filled like bowls, _and_ as the horns of the Altar. 

###### 16 
And the Lord their God shall deliver them in that day as the flock of his people: for _they shall be as_ the stones of the crown lifted up upon his land. 

###### 17 
For how great is his goodness! and how great is his beauty! corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.
