###### 1 
Ask you of the Lord rain in the time of the latter rain: _so_ shall the Lord make white clouds, and give you showers of rain, _and_ to everyone grass in the field. 

###### 2 
Surely the idols have spoken vanity, and the soothsayers have seen a lie, and the dreamers have told a vain thing: they comfort in vain: therefore they went away as sheep: they were troubled, because there was no shepherd. 

###### 3 
My wrath was kindled against the shepherds, and I did visit the goats: but the Lord of hosts will visit his flock the house of Judah, and will make them as his beautiful horse in the battle. 

###### 4 
Out of him shall the corner come forth: out of him the nail, out of him ye bow of battle, _and_ out of him every appointer of tribute also. 

###### 5 
And they shall be as the mighty men, which tread down _their enemies_ in the mire of the streets in the battle, and they shall fight, because the Lord _is_ with them, and the riders on horses shall be confounded. 

###### 6 
And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will preserve the house of Joseph, and I will bring them again, for I pity them: and they shall be as though I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord their God, and will hear them. 

###### 7 
And they of Ephraim shall be as a giant: and their heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall see it, and be glad: _and_ their heart shall rejoice in the Lord. 

###### 8 
I will hiss for them: and gather them: for I have redeemed them: and they shall increase, as they have increased. 

###### 9 
And I will sow them among the people, and they shall remember me in far countries: and they shall live with their children and turn again. 

###### 10 
I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and gather them out of Assyria: and I will bring them into the land of Gilead, and Lebanon, and _place_ shall not be found for them. 

###### 11 
And he shall go into the sea with affliction, and shall smite the waves in the sea, and all the depths of the river shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be cast down, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart away. 

###### 12 
And I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall walk in his Name, saith the Lord.
