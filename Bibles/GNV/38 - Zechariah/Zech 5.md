###### 1 
Then I turned me, and lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold, a flying book. 

###### 2 
And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a flying book: the length thereof _is_ twenty cubits, and the breadth thereof ten cubits. 

###### 3 
Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over the whole earth: for everyone that stealeth, shall be cut off, _as well_ on this side, as on that: and everyone that sweareth, shall be cut off, _as well_ on this side, as on that. 

###### 4 
I will bring it forth, saith the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that falsely sweareth by my Name: and it shall remain in the midst of his house, and shall consume it, with the timber thereof, and stones thereof. 

###### 5 
Then the Angel that talked with me, went forth, and said unto me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth forth. 

###### 6 
And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an Ephah that goeth forth. He said moreover, This is the sight of them through all the earth. 

###### 7 
And behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the Ephah. 

###### 8 
And he said, This is wickedness, and he cast it into the midst of the Ephah, and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth thereof. 

###### 9 
Then I lifted mine eyes, and looked: and behold, there came out two women, and the wind _was_ in their wings (for they had wings like the wings of a stork) and they lifted up the Ephah between the earth and the heaven. 

###### 10 
Then said I to the Angel that talked with me, Whither do these bear the Ephah? 

###### 11 
And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of Shinar, and it shall be established and set there upon her own place.
