###### 1 
In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness. 

###### 2 
And in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols out of the land: and they shall no more be remembered: and I will cause the prophets, and the unclean spirit to depart out of the land. 

###### 3 
And when any shall yet prophesy, his father and his mother that begat him, shall say unto him, Thou shalt not live: for thou speakest lies in the Name of the Lord: and his father and his mother that begat him, shall thrust him through, when he prophesieth. 

###### 4 
And in that day shall the prophets be ashamed everyone of his vision, when he hath prophesied: neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive. 

###### 5 
But he shall say, I am no Prophet: I am an husbandman: for man taught me to be an herdsman from my youth up. 

###### 6 
And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine hands? Then he shall answer, Thus was I wounded in the house of my friends. 

###### 7 
¶ Arise, O sword, upon my shepherd, and upon the man, _that is_ my fellow, saith the Lord of hosts: smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon the little ones. 

###### 8 
And in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts therein shall be cut off, _and_ die: but the third shall be left therein. 

###### 9 
And I will bring that third part through the fire, and will fine them as the silver is fined, and will try them as gold is tried: they shall call on my Name, and I will hear them: I will say, It is my people, and they shall say, The Lord _is_ my God.
