###### 1 
And the Angel that talked with me, came again and waked me, as a man that is raised out of his sleep, 

###### 2 
And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold, a candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps therein, and seven pipes to the lamps which were upon the top thereof, 

###### 3 
And two olive trees over it, one upon the right side of the bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof. 

###### 4 
So I answered and spake to the Angel that talked with me, saying, What are these my Lord? 

###### 5 
Then the Angel that talked with me, answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my Lord. 

###### 6 
Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Neither by an army nor strength, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts. 

###### 7 
Who art thou, O great mountain, before Zerubbabel? _thou shall be_ a plain, and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof, with shoutings, _crying_, Grace, grace unto it. 

###### 8 
Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, 

###### 9 
The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house: his hands shall also finish it, and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me unto you. 

###### 10 
For who hath despised the day of the small things? but they shall rejoice, and shall see the stone of tin in the hand of Zerubbabel: these seven are the eyes of the Lord, which go through the whole world. 

###### 11 
Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive trees upon the right and upon the left side thereof? 

###### 12 
And I spake moreover, and said unto him, What be these two olive branches, which through the two golden pipes empty themselves into the gold? 

###### 13 
And he answered me, and said, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my Lord. 

###### 14 
Then said he, These are the two olive branches, that stand with the ruler of the whole earth.
