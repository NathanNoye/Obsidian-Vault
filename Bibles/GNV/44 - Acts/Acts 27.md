###### 1 
Now when it was concluded, that we should sail into Italy, they delivered both Paul, and certain other prisoners unto a Centurion, named Julius, of the band of Augustus. 

###### 2 
And we entered into a ship of Adramyttium, purposing to sail by the coasts of Asia, and launched forth, and had Aristarchus of Macedonia, a Thessalonian, with us. 

###### 3 
And the next day we arrived at Sidon: and Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends, that they might refresh him. 

###### 4 
And from thence we launched, and sailed hard by Cyprus, because the winds were contrary. 

###### 5 
Then sailed we over the sea by Cilicia, and Pamphilia, and came to Myra, _a city_ in Lycia. 

###### 6 
And there the Centurion found a ship of Alexandria, sailing into Italy, and put us therein. 

###### 7 
And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come against Cnidus, because the wind suffered us not, we sailed hard by Candia, near to Salmone, 

###### 8 
And with much ado sailed beyond it, and came unto a certain place called the Fair Havens, near unto the which was the city Lasea. 

###### 9 
So when much time was spent, and sailing was now jeopardous, because also the Fast was now passed, Paul exhorted _them_, 

###### 10 
And said unto them, Sirs, I see that this voyage will be with hurt, and much damage, not of the lading and ship only, but also of our lives. 

###### 11 
Nevertheless the Centurion believed rather the governor and the master of the ship, than those things which were spoken of Paul. 

###### 12 
And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, many took counsel to depart thence, if by any means they might attain to Phoenix, _there _to winter, which is an haven of Crete, and lieth toward the Southwest and by West, and Northwest and by West. 

###### 13 
And when the Southern wind blew softly, they supposing to attain their purpose, loosed nearer, and sailed by Crete. 

###### 14 
But anon after, there arose by it a stormy wind called Euroclydon. 

###### 15 
And when the ship was caught, and could not resist the wind, we let her go, and were carried away. 

###### 16 
And we ran under a little Isle named Clauda, and had much ado to get the boat. 

###### 17 
Which they took up and used all help, undergirding the ship, fearing lest they should have fallen into Syrtis, and they strake sail, and so were carried. 

###### 18 
The next day when we were tossed with an exceeding tempest, they lightened the ship. 

###### 19 
And the third day we cast out with our own hands the tackling of the ship. 

###### 20 
And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay upon us, all hope that we should be saved, was then taken away. 

###### 21 
But after long abstinence, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened to me, and not have loosed from Candia: so should ye have gained this hurt and loss. 

###### 22 
But now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you, save of the ship only. 

###### 23 
For there stood by me this night the Angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve. 

###### 24 
Saying, Fear not, Paul: for thou must be brought before Caesar: and lo, God hath given unto thee freely, all that sail with thee. 

###### 25 
Wherefore, Sirs, be of good courage: for I believe God, that it shall be so as it hath been told me. 

###### 26 
Howbeit, we must be cast into a certain Island. 

###### 27 
And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were carried to and fro in the Adriatic _sea_ about midnight, the shipmen deemed that some country approached unto them. 

###### 28 
And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms. 

###### 29 
Then fearing lest they should have fallen into some rough places, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished that the day were come. 

###### 30 
Now as the mariners were about to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea under a color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship. 

###### 31 
Paul said unto the Centurion and the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be safe. 

###### 32 
Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let it fall away. 

###### 33 
And when it began to be day, Paul exhorted them all to take meat, saying, This is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried, and continued fasting, receiving nothing: 

###### 34 
Wherefore I exhort you to take meat: for this is for your safeguard: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you. 

###### 35 
And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all, and brake it, and began to eat. 

###### 36 
Then were they all of good courage, and they also took meat. 

###### 37 
Now we were in the ship in all two hundred threescore and sixteen souls. 

###### 38 
And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea. 

###### 39 
And when it was day, they knew not the country, but they spied a certain creek with a bank, into the which they were minded (if it were possible) to thrust in the ship. 

###### 40 
So when they had taken up the anchors, they committed _the ship_ unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bonds, and hoisted up the main sail to the wind, and drew to the shore. 

###### 41 
And when they fell into a place, where two seas met, they thrust in the ship: and the forepart stuck fast, and could not be moved, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves. 

###### 42 
Then the soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them, when he had swam out, should flee away. 

###### 43 
But the Centurion willing to save Paul, stayed them from _this_ counsel, and commanded that they that could swim, should cast themselves first into the sea, and go out to land: 

###### 44 
And the others, some on boards, and some on certain _pieces_ of the ship: and so it came to pass, that they came all safe to land.
