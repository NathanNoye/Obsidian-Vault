###### 1 
Now after five days, Ananias the high Priest came down with the Elders, and _with_ Tertullus a certain orator, which appeared before the governor against Paul. 

###### 2 
And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse _him_, saying, Seeing that we have obtained great quietness through thee, and that many worthy things are done unto this nation through thy providence, 

###### 3 
We acknowledge it wholly, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thanks. 

###### 4 
But that I be not tedious unto thee, I pray thee, that thou wouldest hear us of thy courtesy a few words. 

###### 5 
Certainly we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a chief maintainer of the sect of the Nazarenes: 

###### 6 
And hath gone about to pollute the Temple: therefore we took him, and would have judged him according to our Law: 

###### 7 
But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great violence took him out of our hands, 

###### 8 
Commanding his accusers to come to thee: of whom thou mayest (if thou wilt inquire) know all these things whereof we accuse him. 

###### 9 
And the Jews likewise affirmed, saying that it was so. 

###### 10 
Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him that he should speak, answered, I do the more gladly answer for myself, forasmuch as I know that thou hast been oft many years a judge unto this nation, 

###### 11 
Seeing that thou mayest know, that there are but twelve days since I came up to worship in Jerusalem. 

###### 12 
And they neither found me in the Temple, disputing with any man, neither making uproar among the people, neither in the Synagogues, nor in the city. 

###### 13 
Neither can they prove the things, whereof they now accuse me. 

###### 14 
But this I confess unto thee, that after the way (which they call heresy) so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets, 

###### 15 
And have hope towards God, that the resurrection of the dead, which they themselves look for also, shall be both of just and unjust. 

###### 16 
And herein I endeavor myself to have always a clear conscience toward God and toward men. 

###### 17 
Now after many years, I came and brought alms to my nation and offerings, 

###### 18 
At what time, certain Jews of Asia found me purified in the Temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult. 

###### 19 
Who ought to have been present before thee, and accuse _me_, if they had ought against me. 

###### 20 
Or let these themselves say, if they have found any unjust thing in me, while I stood in the Council, 

###### 21 
Except _it be_ for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Of the resurrection of the dead am I accused of you this day. 

###### 22 
Now when Felix heard these things, he deferred them, and said, When I shall more perfectly know the things which concern this way, by the coming of Lysias the chief Captain, I will decide your matter. 

###### 23 
Then he commanded a Centurion to keep Paul, and that he should have ease, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister unto him, or to come unto him. 

###### 24 
¶ And after certain days, came Felix with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, _and_ he called forth Paul, and heard him of the faith in Christ. 

###### 25 
And as he disputed of righteousness and temperance, and of the judgment to come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time, and when I have convenient time, I will call for thee. 

###### 26 
He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him. 

###### 27 
When two years were expired, Porcius Festus came into Felix's room, and Felix willing to get favor of the Jews, left Paul bound.
