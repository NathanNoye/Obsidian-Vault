###### 1 
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. So Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself. 

###### 2 
I think myself happy, King Agrippa, because I shall answer this day before thee of all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews: 

###### 3 
Chiefly, because thou hast knowledge of all customs, and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. 

###### 4 
As touching my life from _my_ childhood, and what it was from the beginning among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews, 

###### 5 
Which knew me heretofore, even from my Elders (if they would testify) that after the most straight sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee. 

###### 6 
And now I stand and am accused for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers. 

###### 7 
Whereunto our twelve tribes instantly serving _God_ day and night, hope to come: for the which hope's sake, O King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. 

###### 8 
Why should it be thought a thing incredible unto you, that God should raise again the dead? 

###### 9 
I also verily thought in myself, that I ought to do many contrary things against the Name of Jesus of Nazareth. 

###### 10 
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: for many of the Saints I shut up in prison, having received authority of the High Priests, and when they were put to death, I gave _my_ sentence. 

###### 11 
And I punished them throughout all the Synagogues, and compelled them to blaspheme and being more mad against them, I persecuted them, even unto strange cities. 

###### 12 
At which time, even as I went to Damascus with authority, and commission from the high Priests, 

###### 13 
At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven passing the brightness of the sun, shine round about me, and them which went with me. 

###### 14 
So when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, **Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against pricks.

###### 19 
Wherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision, 

###### 20 
But showed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and _then_ to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works worthy amendment of life. 

###### 21 
For this cause the Jews caught me in the Temple, and went about to kill me. 

###### 22 
Nevertheless, I obtained help of God, and continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and to great, saying none other things, than those which the Prophets and Moses did say should come, 

###### 23 
_To wit_, that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should show light unto this people, and to the Gentiles. 

###### 24 
And as he thus answered for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself, much learning doth make thee mad. 

###### 25 
But he said, I am not mad, O noble Festus, but I speak the words of truth, and soberness. 

###### 26 
For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak boldly: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him: for this thing was n done in a corner. 

###### 27 
O King Agrippa, believest thou the Prophets? I know that thou believest. 

###### 28 
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to become a Christian. 

###### 29 
Then Paul said, I would to God that n only thou, but also all that hear me today, were both almost, and altogether such as I am, except these bonds. 

###### 30 
And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them. 

###### 31 
And when they were gone apart, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death, nor of bonds. 

###### 32 
Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been loosed, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
