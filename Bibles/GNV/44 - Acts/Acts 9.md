###### 1 
And Saul yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high Priest, 

###### 2 
And desired of him letters to Damascus to the Synagogues, that if he found any that were of that way, (either men or women) he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. 

###### 3 
Now as he journeyed, it came to pass that as he was come near to Damascus, suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven. 

###### 4 
And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, **Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?

And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, **I am Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against pricks.

###### 6 
He _then_ both trembling and astonied, said, Lord, what wilt thou that I do? And the Lord said unto him, **Arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou shalt do.

###### 7 
The men also which journeyed with him, stood amazed, hearing _his_ voice, but seeing no man. 

###### 8 
And Saul arose from the ground, and opened his eyes, _but_ saw no man. Then led they him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus, 

###### 9 
Where he was three days without sight, and neither ate nor drank. 

###### 10 
And there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias, and to him said the Lord in a vision, **Ananias. **And he said, Behold, I am _here_ Lord. 

###### 11 
Then the Lord said unto him, **Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas after one called Saul of Tarsus: for behold, he prayeth.

###### 12 
(And he saw in a vision a man named Ananias coming in _to him_, and putting his hands on him, that he might receive his sight.) 

###### 13 
Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem. 

###### 14 
Moreover here he hath authority of the high Priests, to bind all that call on thy Name. 

###### 15 
Then the Lord said unto him, **Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my Name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Israel.

###### 17 
Then Ananias went his way, and entered into that house, and put his hands on him, and saith, Brother Saul, the Lord hath sent me (_even_ Jesus that appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest) that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost. 

###### 18 
And immediately there fell from his eyes as _it had been_ scales, and suddenly he received sight, and arose, and was baptized, 

###### 19 
And received meat, and was strengthened. So was Saul certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus. 

###### 20 
And straightway he preached Christ in the Synagogues, that he was that Son of God. 

###### 21 
So that all that heard him were amazed, and said, Is not this he, that made havoc of them which called on this Name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he should bring them bound unto the high Priests? 

###### 22 
But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, confirming that this was that Christ. 

###### 23 
And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him, 

###### 24 
But their laying await was known of Saul: now they watched the gates day and night, that they might kill him. 

###### 25 
Then the disciples took him by night, and put him through the wall, and let him down by a rope in a basket. 

###### 26 
And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself with the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple. 

###### 27 
But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the Apostles, and declared to them, how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken unto him, and how he had spoken boldly at Damascus in the Name of Jesus. 

###### 28 
And he was conversant with them at Jerusalem, 

###### 29 
And spake boldly in the Name of the Lord Jesus, and spake and disputed against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him. 

###### 30 
But when the brethren knew it, they brought him to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus. 

###### 31 
Then had the Churches rest through all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, and were edified, and walked in the fear of the Lord, and were multiplied by the comfort of the holy Ghost. 

###### 32 
And it came to pass, as Peter walked throughout all _quarters_, he came also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda. 

###### 33 
And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his couch eight years, and was sick of the palsy. 

###### 34 
Then said Peter unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole: arise and truss thy couch together. And he arose immediately. 

###### 35 
And all that dwelt at Lydda and Sharon, saw him, and turned to the Lord. 

###### 36 
There was also at Joppa a certain _woman_, a disciple named Tabitha (which by interpretation is called Dorcas) she was full of good works and alms which she did. 

###### 37 
And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick and died: and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber. 

###### 38 
Now forasmuch as Lydda was near to Joppa, and the disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring that he would not delay to come unto them. 

###### 39 
Then Peter arose and came with them: and when he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber, where all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments, which Dorcas made, while she was with them. 

###### 40 
But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed, and turned him to the body, and said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, sat up. 

###### 41 
Then he gave her the hand and lifted her up, and called the Saints and widows, and restored her alive. 

###### 42 
And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. 

###### 43 
And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a Tanner.
