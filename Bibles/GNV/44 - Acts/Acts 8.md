###### 1 
And Saul consented to his death. And at that time, there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Jerusalem, and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and of Samaria, except the Apostles. 

###### 2 
Then _certain_ men fearing God, carried Stephen among them, _to be buried_, and made great lamentation for him. 

###### 3 
But Saul made havoc of the Church, and entered into every house, and drew out both men and women, and put them into prison. 

###### 4 
Therefore they that were scattered abroad, went to and fro preaching the word. 

###### 5 
¶ Then came Philip into the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. 

###### 6 
And the people gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, with one accord, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 

###### 7 
For unclean spirits crying with a loud voice, came out of many that were possessed _of them_: and many taken with palsies, and that halted, were healed. 

###### 8 
And there was great joy in that city. 

###### 9 
And there was before in the city, a certain man called Simon, which used witchcraft, and bewitched the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was some great man, 

###### 10 
To whom they gave heed from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is that great power of God. 

###### 11 
And they gave heed unto him, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 

###### 12 
But as soon as they believed Philip, which preached the things that concerned the kingdom of God, and the Name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women. 

###### 13 
Then Simon himself believed also, and was baptized, and continued with Philip, and wondered, when he saw the signs and great miracles which were done. 

###### 14 
¶ Now when the Apostles, which were at Jerusalem, heard say, that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John. 

###### 15 
Which when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the holy Ghost. 

###### 16 
(For as yet he was fallen down on none of them, but they were baptized only in the Name of the Lord Jesus.) 

###### 17 
Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghost. 

###### 18 
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the Apostles' hands the holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 

###### 19 
Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay the hands, he may receive the holy Ghost. 

###### 20 
Then said Peter unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou thinkest that the gift of God may be obtained with money. 

###### 21 
Thou hast neither part nor fellowship in this business: for thine heart is not right in the sight of God. 

###### 22 
Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, that if it be possible, the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 

###### 23 
For I see that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. 

###### 24 
Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken, come upon me. 

###### 25 
¶ So they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the Gospel in many towns of the Samaritans. 

###### 26 
Then the Angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the South unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is waste. 

###### 27 
And he arose and went on: and behold, a certain Eunuch of Ethiopia, Candace the Queen of the Ethiopians' chief Governor, who had the rule of all her treasure, and came to Jerusalem to worship. 

###### 28 
And as he returned sitting in his chariot, he read Isaiah the Prophet. 

###### 29 
Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near and join thyself to yonder chariot. 

###### 30 
And Philip ran thither, and heard him read the Prophet Isaiah, and said, But understandest thou what thou readest? 

###### 31 
And he said, How can I, except I had a guide? And he desired Philip, that he would come up and sit with him. 

###### 32 
Now the place of the Scripture which he read, was this, He was lead as a sheep to the slaughter: and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth. 

###### 33 
In his humility his judgment hath been exalted: but who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 

###### 34 
Then the Eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the Prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 

###### 35 
Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus. 

###### 36 
And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water, and the Eunuch said, See, here _is_ water: what doth let me to be baptized? 

###### 37 
And Philip said unto him, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. Then he answered, and said, I believe that that Jesus Christ is that Son of God. 

###### 38 
Then he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the Eunuch, and he baptized him. 

###### 39 
And as soon as they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the Eunuch saw him no more: so he went on his way rejoicing. 

###### 40 
But Philip was found at Azotus, and he walked to and fro preaching in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
