###### 1 
And in those days, as the number of the disciples grew, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians towards the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministering. 

###### 2 
Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples together, and said, It is not meet that we should leave the word of God to serve the tables. 

###### 3 
Wherefore brethren, look you out among you seven men of honest report, and full of the holy Ghost, and of wisdom, which we may appoint to this business. 

###### 4 
And we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministration of the word. 

###### 5 
And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen a man full of faith and of the holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a Proselyte of Antioch, 

###### 6 
Which they set before the Apostles: and they prayed, and laid their hands on them. 

###### 7 
And the word of God increased, and the number of the disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem greatly, and a great company of the Priests were obedient to the faith. 

###### 8 
¶ Now Stephen full of faith and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people. 

###### 9 
Then there arose certain of the Synagogue, which are called Libertines, and Cyrenians, and of Alexandria, and of them of Cilicia, and of Asia, and disputed with Stephen. 

###### 10 
But they were not able to resist the wisdom, and the Spirit by the which he spake. 

###### 11 
Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and God. 

###### 12 
Thus they moved the people and the Elders, and the Scribes: and running upon him, caught him, and brought him to the Council, 

###### 13 
And set forth false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the Law. 

###### 14 
For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the ordinances which Moses gave us. 

###### 15 
And as all that sat in the Council looked steadfastly on him, they saw his face as _it had been_ the face of an Angel.
