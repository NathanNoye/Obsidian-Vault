###### 1 
I Charge _thee_ therefore before God, and _before_ the Lord Jesus Christ, which shall judge the quick and dead at that his appearing, and in his kingdom, 

###### 2 
Preach the word: be instant, in season, and out of season: improve, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine. 

###### 3 
For the time will come when they will not suffer wholesome doctrine: but having their ears itching, shall after their own lusts get them an heap of teachers, 

###### 4 
And shall turn their ears from the truth, and shall be given unto fables. 

###### 5 
But watch thou in all things: suffer adversity: do the work of an Evangelist: cause thy ministry to be thoroughly liked of. 

###### 6 
For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departing is at hand. 

###### 7 
I have fought a good fight, and have finished my course: I have kept the faith. 

###### 8 
_For_ henceforth is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous Judge shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love that his appearing. 

###### 9 
Make speed to come unto me at once: 

###### 10 
For Demas hath forsaken me, and hath embraced this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica. Crescens _is gone_ to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia. 

###### 11 
Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with thee: for he is profitable unto me to minister. 

###### 12 
And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus. 

###### 13 
The cloak that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but specially the parchments. 

###### 14 
Alexander the coppersmith hath done me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works. 

###### 15 
Of whom be thou ware also: for he withstood our preaching sore. 

###### 16 
At my first answering no man assisted me, but all forsook me: _I pray God,_ that it may not be laid to their charge. 

###### 17 
Notwithstanding the Lord assisted me, and strengthened me, that by me the preaching might be fully believed, and that all the Gentiles should hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion. 

###### 18 
And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom _be_ praise for ever and ever, Amen. 

###### 19 
Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus. 

###### 20 
Erastus abode at Corinth: Trophimus I left at Miletus sick. 

###### 21 
Make speed to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren. 

###### 22 
The Lord Jesus Christ _be_ with thy Spirit. Grace _be_ with you, Amen. ¶ The second _Epistle_ written from Rome unto Timothy, the first Bishop elected of the Church of Ephesus, when Paul was presented the second time before the Emperor Nero.
