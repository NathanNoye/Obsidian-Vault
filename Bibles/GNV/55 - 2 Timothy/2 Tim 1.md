###### 1 
Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus, 

###### 2 
To Timothy _my_ beloved son: Grace, mercy _and_ peace from God the Father, and _from_ Jesus Christ our Lord. 

###### 3 
I thank God, whom I serve from _mine_ elders with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day. 

###### 4 
Desiring to see thee, mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy: 

###### 5 
When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice, and am assured that _it dwelleth_ in thee also. 

###### 6 
Wherefore, I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of mine hands. 

###### 7 
For God hath not given to us the Spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind. 

###### 8 
Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, neither of me his prisoner: but be partaker of the afflictions of the Gospel according to the power of God, 

###### 9 
Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given to us through Christ Jesus before the world was, 

###### 10 
But is now made manifest by that appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality unto light through the Gospel. 

###### 11 
Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and Apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles. 

###### 12 
For the which cause I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day. 

###### 13 
Keep the true pattern of the wholesome words, which thou hast heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. 

###### 14 
That worthy thing, which was committed to thee, keep through the holy Ghost, which dwelleth in us. 

###### 15 
This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia, be turned from me: of which sort are Phygellus and Hermogenes. 

###### 16 
The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus: for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain, 

###### 17 
But when he was at Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found _me_. 

###### 18 
The Lord grant unto him, that he may find mercy with the Lord at that day, and in how many things he hath ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well.
