###### 1 
Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. 

###### 2 
And what things thou hast heard of me, by many witnesses, the same deliver to faithful men, which shall be able to teach others also. 

###### 3 
Thou therefore suffer affliction as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. 

###### 4 
No man that warreth, entangleth himself with the affairs of _this_ life, because he would please him that hath chosen him to be a soldier. 

###### 5 
And if any man also strive for a mastery, he is not crowned, except he strive as he ought to do. 

###### 6 
The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits. 

###### 7 
Consider what I say: and the Lord give thee understanding in all things. 

###### 8 
Remember that Jesus Christ, _made_ of the seed of David, was raised again from the dead according to my Gospel, 

###### 9 
Wherein I suffer trouble as an evil doer, even unto bonds: but the word of God is not bound. 

###### 10 
Therefore I suffer all things for the elect's sake, that they might also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus, with eternal glory. 

###### 11 
_It is_ a true saying, For if we be dead together _with him:_ we also shall live together _with him. _ 

###### 12 
If we suffer, we shall also reign together _with him_: if we deny _him_, he also will deny us. 

###### 13 
If we believe not, _yet_ abideth he faithful: he cannot deny himself. 

###### 14 
Of these things put them in remembrance, and protest before the Lord, that they strive not about words, which is to no profit, _but_ to the perverting of the hearers. 

###### 15 
Study to show thyself approved unto God a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, dividing the word of truth aright. 

###### 16 
Stay profane, and vain babblings: for they shall increase unto more ungodliness. 

###### 17 
And their word shall fret as a canker: of which sort is Hymenaeus and Philetus. 

###### 18 
Which as concerning the truth have erred from the mark, saying that the resurrection is past already, and do destroy the faith of certain. 

###### 19 
But the foundation of God remaineth sure, and hath this seal, The Lord knoweth who are his: and, Let everyone that calleth on the Name of Christ, depart from iniquity. 

###### 20 
Notwithstanding in a great house are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some for honor, and some unto dishonor. 

###### 21 
If any man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, and meet for the Lord, and prepared unto every good work. 

###### 22 
Flee also from the lusts of youth, and follow after righteousness, faith, love, _and_ peace, with them that call on the Lord with pure heart, 

###### 23 
And put away foolish and unlearned questions, knowing that they engender strife. 

###### 24 
But the servant of the Lord must not strive, but _must_ be gentle toward all men, apt to teach, suffering the evil, 

###### 25 
Instructing them with meekness that are contrary minded, _proving_ if God at any time will give them repentance, that they may acknowledge the truth, 

###### 26 
And come to amendment out of that snare of the devil, of whom they are taken prisoners, to _do_ his will.
