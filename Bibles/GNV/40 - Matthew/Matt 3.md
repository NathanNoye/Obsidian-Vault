###### 1 
And in those days, John the Baptist came and preached in the wilderness of Judea, 

###### 2 
And said, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. 

###### 3 
For this is he of whom it is spoken by the Prophet Isaiah, saying, The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make his paths straight. 

###### 4 
And this John had his garment of camel's hair, and a girdle of a skin about his loins, his meat was also locusts and wild honey. 

###### 5 
Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, 

###### 6 
And they were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins. 

###### 7 
Now when he saw many of the Pharisees, and of the Sadducees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath forewarned you to flee from the anger to come? 

###### 8 
Bring forth therefore fruit worthy amendment of life, 

###### 9 
And think not to say with yourselves, We have Abraham to _our_ father: for I say unto you, that God is able even of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham. 

###### 10 
And now also is the axe put to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and cast into the fire. 

###### 11 
Indeed I baptize you with water to amendment of life, but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, he will baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with fire. 

###### 12 
Which hath his fan in his hand, and will make clean his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner, but will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. 

###### 13 
¶ Then came Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John to be baptized of him. 

###### 14 
But John earnestly put him back, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me? 

###### 15 
Then Jesus answering, said to him, **Let be now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. **So he suffered him. 

###### 16 
And Jesus when he was baptized, came straight out of the water. And lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and _John_ saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and n upon him. 

###### 17 
And lo, a voice _came_ from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
