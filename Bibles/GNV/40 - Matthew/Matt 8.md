###### 1 
Now when he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed him. 

###### 2 
And lo, there came a Leper and worshipped him, saying, Master, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. 

###### 3 
And Jesus putting forth his hand, touched him, saying, **I will, be thou clean: **and immediately his leprosy was cleansed. 

###### 4 
Then Jesus said unto him, **See thou tell no man, but go, **_**and **_**show thyself unto the Priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a witness to them.

###### 5 
¶ When Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a Centurion, beseeching him, 

###### 6 
And said, Master, my servant lieth sick at home of the palsy, and is grievously pained. 

###### 7 
And Jesus said unto him, **I will come and heal him.

###### 8 
But the Centurion answered, saying, Master, I am not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. 

###### 9 
For I am a man also under the authority _of another_, and have soldiers under me: and I say to one, Go, and he goeth: and to another, Come, and he cometh: and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it. 

###### 10 
When Jesus heard _that_, he marveled, and said to them that followed _him_, **Verily, I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, even in Israel.

###### 13 
Then Jesus said unto the Centurion, **Go thy way, and as thou hast believed, so be it unto thee**. And his servant was healed the same hour. 

###### 14 
¶ And when Jesus came to Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid down, and sick of a fever. 

###### 15 
And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: so she arose, and ministered unto them. 

###### 16 
When the Even was come, they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with _his_ word, and healed all that were sick, 

###### 17 
That it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by Isaiah the Prophet, saying, He took our infirmities, and bare _our_ sicknesses. 

###### 18 
¶ And when Jesus saw great multitudes of people about him, he commanded them to go over _the water_. 

###### 19 
Then came there a certain Scribe, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest. 

###### 20 
But Jesus said unto him, **The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven have nests, but the Son of man hath not whereon to rest his head.

###### 21 
¶ And another of his disciples said unto him, Master, suffer me first to go, and bury my father. 

###### 22 
But Jesus said unto him, **Follow me, and let the dead bury the dead.

###### 23 
¶ And when he was entered into the ship, his disciples followed him. 

###### 24 
And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with waves: but he was asleep. 

###### 25 
Then his disciples came, and awoke him, saying, Master, save us: we perish. 

###### 26 
And he said unto them, **Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? **Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea: and _so_ there was a great calm. 

###### 27 
And the men marveled, saying, What man is this, that both the winds and the sea obey him? 

###### 28 
¶ And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils which came out of the graves very fierce, so that no man might go by that way. 

###### 29 
And behold, they cried out, saying, Jesus the son of God, what have we to do with thee? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time? 

###### 30 
Now there was afar off from them, a great herd of swine feeding. 

###### 31 
And the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine. 

###### 32 
And he said unto them, **Go. **So they went out and departed into the herd of swine: and behold, the whole herd of swine ran headlong into the sea, and died in the water. 

###### 33 
Then the herdmen fled: and when they were come into the city, they told all things, and what was become of them that were possessed with the devils, 

###### 34 
And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus: and when they saw him, they besought him to depart out of their coasts.
