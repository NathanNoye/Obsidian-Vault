###### 1 
The book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David, the son of Abraham. 

###### 2 
Abraham begat Isaac. And Isaac begat Jacob. And Jacob begat Judah and his brethren. 

###### 3 
And Judah begat Perez, and Zerah of Tamar. And Perez begat Hezron. And Hezron begat Ram. 

###### 4 
And Ram begat Amminadab. And Amminadab begat Nahshon. And Nahshon begat Salmon. 

###### 5 
And Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab. And Boaz begat Obed of Ruth. And Obed begat Jesse. 

###### 6 
And Jesse begat David the King. And David the King begat Solomon of her that was _the wife_ of Uriah. 

###### 7 
And Solomon begat Rehoboam. And Rehoboam begat Abijah. And Abijah begat Asa. 

###### 8 
And Asa begat Jehoshaphat. And Jehoshaphat begat Joram. And Joram begat Uzziah. 

###### 9 
And Uzziah begat Jotham. And Jotham begat Ahaz. And Ahaz begat Hezekiah. 

###### 10 
And Hezekiah begat Manasseh. And Manasseh begat Amon. And Amon begat Josiah. 

###### 11 
And Josiah begat Jakim. And Jakim begat Jeconiah and his brethren about the time they were carried away to Babylon. 

###### 12 
And after they were carried away into Babylon, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel. And Shealtiel be-gat Zerubbabel. 

###### 13 
And Zerubbabel begat Abiud. And Abiud begat Eliakim. And Eliakim begat Azor. 

###### 14 
And Azor begat Zadok. And Zadok begat Achim. And Achim begat Eliud. 

###### 15 
And Eliud begat Eleazar. And Eleazar begat Matthan. And Matthan begat Jacob. 

###### 16 
And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, that is called Christ. 

###### 17 
So all the generations from Abraham to David, _are_ fourteen generations. And from David until they were carried away into Babylon, fourteen generations: and after they were carried away into Babylon until Christ, fourteen generations. 

###### 18 
¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus, When as his mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the holy Ghost. 

###### 19 
Then Joseph her husband being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly. 

###### 20 
But while he thought these things, behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, the son of David, fear not to take Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her, is of the holy Ghost. 

###### 21 
And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. 

###### 22 
And all this was done that it might be fulfilled, which is spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, 

###### 23 
Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bear a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which is by interpretation, God with us. 

###### 24 
¶ Then Joseph being raised from sleep, did as the Angel of the Lord had enjoined him, and took his wife. 

###### 25 
But he knew her not, till she had brought forth her first born son, and he called his name JESUS.
