###### 1 
Now in the end of the Sabbath, when the first _day_ of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, came to see the sepulcher. 

###### 2 
And behold, there was a great earthquake: for the Angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and sat upon it. 

###### 3 
And his countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow. 

###### 4 
And for fear of him, the keepers were astonied, and became as dead men. 

###### 5 
But the Angel answered, and said to the women, Fear ye not: for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified: 

###### 6 
He is not here, for he is risen, as he said: come, see the place where the Lord was laid, 

###### 7 
And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead: and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee: there ye shall see him: lo, I have told you. 

###### 8 
So they departed quickly from the sepulcher, with fear and great joy, and did run to bring his disciples word. 

###### 9 
And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus also met them, saying, **God save you. **And they came, and took him by the feet, and worshipped him. 

###### 10 
Then said Jesus unto them, **Be not afraid. Go, **_**and**_** tell my brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.

###### 11 
¶ Now when they were gone, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed unto the high Priests all the things that were done. 

###### 12 
And they gathered them together with the Elders, and took counsel, and gave large money unto the soldiers, 

###### 13 
Saying, Say, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept. 

###### 14 
And if this matter come before the governor to be heard, we will persuade him, and so use the matter that you shall not need to care, 

###### 15 
So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this saying is noised among the Jews unto this day. 

###### 16 
¶ Then the eleven disciples went into Galilee, into a mountain, where Jesus had appointed them. 

###### 17 
And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted. 

###### 18 
And Jesus came, and spake unto them, saying, **All power is given unto me, in heaven, and in earth.
