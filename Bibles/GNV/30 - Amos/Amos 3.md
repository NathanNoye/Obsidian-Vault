###### 1 
Hear this word that the Lord pronounceth against you, O children of Israel, _even_ against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt, saying, 

###### 2 
You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit you for all your iniquities. 

###### 3 
Can two walk together except they be agreed? 

###### 4 
Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? or will a lion's whelp cry out of his den, if he hath taken nothing? 

###### 5 
Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no fowler is? or will he take up the snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all? 

###### 6 
Or shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people be not afraid? or shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done it? 

###### 7 
Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the Prophets. 

###### 8 
The lion hath roared: who will not be afraid? the Lord God hath spoken, who can but prophesy? 

###### 9 
Proclaim in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains of Samaria: so behold the great tumults in the midst thereof, and the oppressed in the midst thereof. 

###### 10 
For they know not to do right, saith the Lord: they store up violence, and robbery in their palaces. 

###### 11 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, An adversary _shall come_ even round about the country, and shall bring down thy strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled. 

###### 12 
Thus saith the Lord, As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear: so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed: and in Damascus, _as in_ a couch. 

###### 13 
Hear, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord God, the God of hosts. 

###### 14 
Surely in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel upon him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel, and the horns of the altar shall be broken off, and fall to the ground. 

###### 15 
And I will smite the winter house with the summer house, and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall be consumed, saith the Lord.
