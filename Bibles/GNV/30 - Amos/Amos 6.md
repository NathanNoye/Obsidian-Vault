###### 1 
Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the mountain of Samaria, which were famous at the beginning of the nations: and the house of Israel came to them. 

###### 2 
Go you unto Calneh, and see: and from thence go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or the border of their land greater than your border, 

###### 3 
Ye that put far away the evil day, and approach to the seat of iniquity? 

###### 4 
They lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their beds, and eat the lambs of the flock, and the calves out of the stall. 

###### 5 
They sing to the sound of the viol: they invent to themselves instruments of music like David. 

###### 6 
They drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief ointments, but no man is sorry for the affliction of Joseph. 

###### 7 
Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go captive, and the sorrow of them that stretched themselves, is at hand. 

###### 8 
The Lord God hath sworn by himself, saith the Lord God of hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces: therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein. 

###### 9 
And if there remain ten men in one house, they shall die. 

###### 10 
And his uncle shall take him up and burn him, to carry out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto him, that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with thee? And he shall say, None. Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue: for we may not remember the Name of the Lord. 

###### 11 
For behold, the Lord commandeth, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts. 

###### 12 
Shall horses run upon the rock? or will one plow _there_ with oxen? for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood. 

###### 13 
Yet rejoice in a thing of nought: ye say, Have not we gotten us horns by our own strength? 

###### 14 
But behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God of hosts: and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness.
