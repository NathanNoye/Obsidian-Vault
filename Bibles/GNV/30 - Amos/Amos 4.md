###### 1 
Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, _and_ destroy the needy, and they say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink. 

###### 2 
The Lord God hath sworn by his holiness, that lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with thorns, and your posterity with fish-hooks. 

###### 3 
And ye shall go out at the breaches every _cow_ forward: and ye shall cast yourselves out of the palace, saith the Lord. 

###### 4 
Come to Bethel, and transgress: to Gilgal, and multiply transgression, and bring your sacrifices in the morning, _and_ your riches after three years. 

###### 5 
And offer a thanksgiving of leaven, publish _and_ proclaim the free offerings: for this liketh you, O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord God. 

###### 6 
And therefore have I given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and scarceness of bread in all your places, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

###### 7 
And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there _were_ yet three months to the harvest, and I caused it to rain upon one city, and have not caused it to rain upon another city: one piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not, withered. 

###### 8 
So two _or_ three cities wandered unto one city to drink water, but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

###### 9 
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: your great gardens and your vineyards, and your fig trees, and your olive trees did the palmerworm devour: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

###### 10 
Pestilence have I sent among you after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have taken away your horses: and I have made the stink of your tents to come up even into your nostrils, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

###### 11 
I have overthrown you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah: and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning, yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the Lord. 

###### 12 
Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I will do thus unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. 

###### 13 
For lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought: which maketh the morning darkness, and walketh upon the high places of the earth, the Lord God of hosts _is_ his Name.
