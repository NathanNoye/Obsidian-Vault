###### 1 
Hear ye this word, which I lift up upon you, _even_ a lamentation of the house of Israel. 

###### 2 
The virgin Israel is fallen, _and_ shall no more rise: she is left upon her land, _and_ there _is_ none to raise her up. 

###### 3 
For thus saith the Lord God, The city which went out by a thousand, shall leave an hundred: and that which went forth by an hundred, shall leave ten to the house of Israel. 

###### 4 
For thus saith the Lord unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live. 

###### 5 
But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and go not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nought. 

###### 6 
Seek the Lord, and ye shall live, lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph and devour it, and there _be_ none to quench it in Bethel. 

###### 7 
They turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth. 

###### 8 
He maketh Pleiades, and Orion, and he turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and he maketh the day dark as night: he calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the open earth: the Lord _is_ his Name. 

###### 9 
He strengtheneth the destroyer against the mighty, and the destroyer shall come against the fortress. 

###### 10 
They have hated him that rebuked in the gate: and they abhorred him that speaketh uprightly. 

###### 11 
Forasmuch then as your treading _is_ upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat, ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them: ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them. 

###### 12 
For I know your manifold transgressions, and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take rewards, and they oppress the poor in the gate. 

###### 13 
Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time, for it is an evil time. 

###### 14 
Seek good and not evil, that ye may live: and the Lord God of hosts shall be with you, as you have spoken. 

###### 15 
Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the Lord God of hosts will be merciful unto the remnant of Joseph. 

###### 16 
Therefore the Lord God of hosts, the Lord saith thus, Mourning _shall be_ in all streets: and they shall say in all the high ways, Alas, alas: and they shall call the husbandman to lamentation, and such as can mourn, to mourning. 

###### 17 
And in all the vines _shall be_ lamentation: for I will pass through thee, saith the Lord. 

###### 18 
Woe unto you, that desire the day of the Lord: what have you to do with it? the day of the Lord _is_ darkness and not light, 

###### 19 
As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him: or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him. 

###### 20 
Shall not the day of the Lord be darkness, and not light, even darkness and no light in it? 

###### 21 
I hate _and_ abhor your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies. 

###### 22 
Though ye offer me burnt offerings and meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts. 

###### 23 
Take thou away from me the multitude of thy songs (for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.) 

###### 24 
And let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty river. 

###### 25 
Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel? 

###### 26 
But you have born Sikkuth your king, and Chiun your images, _and_ the star of your gods which you made to yourselves. 

###### 27 
Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the Lord, whose Name _is_ the God of hosts.
