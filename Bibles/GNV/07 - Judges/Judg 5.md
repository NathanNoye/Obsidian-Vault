###### 1 
Then sang Deborah, and Barak the son of Abinoam the same day, saying, 

###### 2 
Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, _and_ for the people that offered themselves willingly. 

###### 3 
Hear, ye kings, hearken ye princes: I, _even_ I will sing unto the Lord: I will sing praise unto the Lord God of Israel. 

###### 4 
Lord, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou departedst out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens rained, the clouds also dropped water. 

###### 5 
The mountains melted before the Lord, _as did_ that Sinai before the Lord God of Israel. 

###### 6 
In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of  Jael, the highways were unoccupied, and the travelers walked through byways. 

###### 7 
The towns were not inhabited: they decayed, I _say_, in Israel, until I Deborah came up, which rose up a mother in Israel. 

###### 8 
They chose new gods: then _was_ war in the gates. Was there a shield or spear seen among forty thousand of Israel? 

###### 9 
Mine heart _is set_ on the governors of Israel, _and_ on them that are willing among the people: praise ye the Lord. 

###### 10 
Speak ye that ride on white asses, ye that dwell by Middin, and that walk by the way. 

###### 11 
For the noise of the archers _appraised_ among the drawers of water: there shall they rehearse the righteousness of the Lord, his righteousness of his towns in Israel: then did the people of the Lord go down to the gates. 

###### 12 
Up Deborah, up, arise, _and _sing a song: arise Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam. 

###### 13 
For they that remain, have dominion over the mighty of the people: the Lord hath given me dominion over the strong. 

###### 14 
Of Ephraim their root _arose_ against Amalek: _and_ after thee Benjamin _shall fight_ against thy people, _O Amalek_, of Machir came rulers, and of Zebulun, they that handle the pen of the writer. 

###### 15 
And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah, and Issachar, and also Barak: he was set on his feet in the valley: for the divisions of Reuben _were_ great thoughts of heart. 

###### 16 
Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of the flocks? for the divisions of Reuben _were_ great thoughts of heart. 

###### 17 
Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why doth Dan remain in ships? Asher sat on the seashore, and tarried in his decayed places. 

###### 18 
_But_ the people of Zebulun and Naphtali have jeopardized their lives unto the death in the high places of the field. 

###### 19 
The Kings came _and_ fought: then fought the Kings of Canaan in Taanach by the waters of Megiddo: they received no gain of money. 

###### 20 
They fought from heaven, _even_ the stars in their courses fought against Sisera. 

###### 21 
The River Kishon swept them away, that ancient river the river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast marched valiantly. 

###### 22 
Then were the horse hoofs broken with the oft beating together of their mighty _men_. 

###### 23 
Curse ye Meroz: (said the Angel of the Lord) curse the inhabitants thereof, because they came not to help the Lord, to help the Lord against the mighty. 

###### 24 
Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite shall be blessed above _other_ women: blessed shall she be above women _dwelling_ in tents. 

###### 25 
He asked water, _and_ she gave him milk: she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. 

###### 26 
She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman's hammer: with the hammer smote she Sisera: she smote off his head, after she had wounded and pierced his temples. 

###### 27 
He bowed him down at her feet, he fell down, and lay still: at her feet he bowed him down, and fell: and when he had sunk down, he lay there dead. 

###### 28 
The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long a coming? why tarry the wheels of his chariots? 

###### 29 
Her wise ladies answered her, Yea. She answered herself with her own words, 

###### 30 
Have they not gotten, _and_ they divide the spoil? every man hath a maid or two. Sisera hath a prey of diverse colored _garments_, a prey of sundry colors made of needle work: of diverse colors of needle work on both sides, for the chief of the spoil. 

###### 31 
So let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: but they that love him, shall be as the Sun when he riseth in his might, and the land had rest forty years.
