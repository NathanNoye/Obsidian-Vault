###### 1 
There was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah, 

###### 2 
And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred _shekels_ of silver that were taken from thee, for the which thou cursedst, and spakedst it, even in mine hearing, behold, the silver _is_ with me, I took it. Then his mother said, Blessed be my son of the Lord. 

###### 3 
And when he had restored the eleven hundred _shekels_ of silver to his mother, his mother said, I had dedicate the silver to the Lord of mine hand for my son, to make a graven and molten image. Now therefore I will give it thee again. 

###### 4 
And when he had restored the money unto his mother, his mother took two hundred _shekels_ of silver, and gave them to the founder, which made thereof a graven and molten image, and it was in the house of Micah. 

###### 5 
And this man Micah had an house of gods, and made an Ephod, and Teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who was his Priest. 

###### 6 
In those days there was no King in Israel, _but_ every man did that which was good in his own eyes. 

###### 7 
¶ There was also a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family of Judah: who was a Levite, and sojourned there. 

###### 8 
And the man departed out of the city, _even_ out of Bethlehem Judah, to dwell where he could find _a place_: and as he journeyed, he came to mount Ephraim to the house of Micah. 

###### 9 
And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And the Levite answered him, I _come_ from Bethlehem Judah, and go to dwell where I may find _a place_. 

###### 10 
Then Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father and a Priest, and I will give thee ten _shekels_ of silver by year, and a suit of apparel, and thy meat and drink. So the Levite went in. 

###### 11 
And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man was unto him as one of his own sons. 

###### 12 
And Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man was his Priest, and was in the house of Micah. 

###### 13 
Then said Micah, Now I know that the Lord will be good unto me, seeing I have a Levite to my Priest.
