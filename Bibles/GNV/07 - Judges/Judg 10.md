###### 1 
After Abimelech, there arose to defend Israel, Tola, the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, which dwelt in Shamir in mount Ephraim. 

###### 2 
And he judged Israel three and twenty years, and died, and was buried in Shamir. 

###### 3 
¶ And after him arose Jair a Gileadite, and judged Israel two and twenty years. 

###### 4 
And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty asscolts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havoth Jair unto this day, and are in the land of Gilead. 

###### 5 
And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. 

###### 6 
¶ And the children of Israel wrought wickedness again in the sight of the Lord, and served Baal and Ashtoreth, and the gods of Aram, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the Lord and served not him. 

###### 7 
Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the children of Ammon: 

###### 8 
Who from that year vexed and oppressed the children of Israel eighteen years, _even_ all the children of Israel that were beyond Jordan, in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 

###### 9 
Moreover, the children of Ammon went over Jordan to fight against Judah and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim: so that Israel was sore tormented. 

###### 10 
Then the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our own God, and have served Baal. 

###### 11 
And the Lord said unto the children of Israel, _Did not I deliver you_ from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines? 

###### 12 
The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites did oppress you, and ye cried to me, and I saved you out of their hands. 

###### 13 
Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: Wherefore I will deliver you no more. 

###### 14 
Go, and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen: let them save you in the time of your tribulation. 

###### 15 
And the children of Israel said unto the Lord, We have sinned: do thou unto us whatsoever please thee: only we pray thee to deliver us this day. 

###### 16 
Then they put away the strange gods from among them, and served the Lord: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel. 

###### 17 
Then the children of Ammon gathered themselves together, and pitched in Gilead: and the children of Israel assembled themselves, and pitched in Mizpah. 

###### 18 
And the people _and_ princes of Gilead said one to another, Whosoever will begin the battle against the children of Ammon, the same shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.
