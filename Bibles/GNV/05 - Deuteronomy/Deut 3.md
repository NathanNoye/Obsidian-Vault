###### 1 
Then we turned, and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og King of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people to fight at Edrei. 

###### 2 
And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not, for I will deliver him, and all his people, and his land into thine hand, and thou shalt do unto him as thou diddest unto Sihon King of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon. 

###### 3 
So the Lord our God delivered also unto our hand, Og the King of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him, until none was left him _alive_. 

###### 4 
And we took all his cities the same time, neither was there a city which we took not from them, _even_ three score cities, _and_ all the country of Argob, _even_ the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 

###### 5 
All these cities _were_ fenced with high walls, gates and bars, beside unwalled towns a great many. 

###### 6 
And we overthrew them, as we did unto Sihon King of Heshbon, destroying every city, _with_ men, women, and children. 

###### 7 
But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took for ourselves. 

###### 8 
Thus we took at that time out of the hand of two Kings of the Amorites, the land that was on this side Jordan from the river of Arnon unto mount Hermon: 

###### 9 
(Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, but the Amorites call it Senir) 

###### 10 
All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan unto Salcah, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 

###### 11 
For only Og King of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Giants, whose bed _was_ a bed of iron: is it not at Rabbath among the children of Ammon? the length thereof _is_ nine cubits, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man. 

###### 12 
And this land _which_ we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and Gadites. 

###### 13 
And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh: _even_ all the country of Argob with all Bashan, which is called, The land of giants. 

###### 14 
Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, unto the coasts of Geshuri, and of Maachathi: and called them after his own name, Bashan, Havoth Jair unto this day. 

###### 15 
And I gave _part_ of Gilead unto Machir. 

###### 16 
And unto the Reubenites and Gadites I gave _the rest_ of Gilead, and unto the river of Arnon, half the river and the borders, even unto the river Jabbok, _which is_ the border of the children of Ammon: 

###### 17 
The plain also and Jordan, and the borders from Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, _to wit_, the salt Sea under the springs of Pisgah Eastward. 

###### 18 
¶ And I commanded you the same time, saying, The Lord your God hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall go over armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all men of war. 

###### 19 
Your wives only, and your children, and your cattle (for I know that ye have much cattle) shall abide in your cities, which I have given you, 

###### 20 
Until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren as unto you, and that they also possess the land, which the Lord your God hath given them beyond Jordan: then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given you. 

###### 21 
¶ And I charged Joshua the same time, saying, Thine eyes have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two Kings: so shall the Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou goest. 

###### 22 
Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God, he shall fight for you. 

###### 23 
And I besought the Lord the same time, saying, 

###### 24 
O Lord God, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand: for where is there a God in heaven or in earth, that can do like thy works, and like thy power? 

###### 25 
I pray thee let me go over and see the good land that is beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon. 

###### 26 
But the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee, speak no more unto me of this matter. 

###### 27 
Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes Westward, and Northward, and Southward, and Eastward, and behold it with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan: 

###### 28 
But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and bolden him: for he shall go before this people, and he shall divide for inheritance unto them, the land which thou shalt see. 

###### 29 
So we abode in the valley over against Beth Peor.
