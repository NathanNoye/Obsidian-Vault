###### 1 
Now this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death, and said, 

###### 2 
The Lord came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them, _and_ appeared clearly from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of Saints, _and_ at his right hand a fiery Law for them. 

###### 3 
Though he love the people, _yet_ all thy Saints are in thine hands: and they are humbled at thy feet, to receive thy words. 

###### 4 
Moses commanded us a Law for an inheritance of the Congregation of Jacob. 

###### 5 
Then he was among the righteous _people_, _as_ King, when the heads of the people, and the tribes of Israel were assembled. 

###### 6 
¶ Let Reuben live, and not die, though his men be a small number. 

###### 7 
¶ And thus _he blessed_ Judah, and said, Hear, O Lord, the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: his hands shall be sufficient for him, if thou help him against his enemies. 

###### 8 
¶ And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thine Urim be with thine Holy one, whom thou didst prove in Massah, _and_ didst cause him to strive at the waters of Meribah. 

###### 9 
Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen him, neither knew he his brethren, nor knew his own children: for they observed thy word, and kept thy Covenant. 

###### 10 
They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy Law: they shall put incense before thy face, and the burnt offering upon thine Altar. 

###### 11 
Bless, O Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands: smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of them that hate him, that they rise not again. 

###### 12 
¶ Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in safety by him: _the Lord_ shall cover him all the day long, and dwell between his shoulders. 

###### 13 
¶ And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the Lord is _his_ land for the sweetness of heaven, for the dew, and for the depth lying beneath, 

###### 14 
And for the sweet increase of the Sun, and for the sweet increase of the Moon, 

###### 15 
And for _thy sweetness_ of the top of the ancient mountains, and for the sweetness of the old hills, 

###### 16 
And for the sweetness of the earth, and abundance therefore: and the good will of him that dwelt in the bush, shall come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the head of him that was separated _from_ his brethren. 

###### 17 
His beauty _shall be like_ his firstborn bullock, and his horns _as_ the horns of an unicorn: with them he shall smite the people together, _even_ the ends of the world: these are also the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these are the thousands of Manasseh. 

###### 18 
¶ And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out, and _thou_ Issachar in thy tents. 

###### 19 
They shall call the people unto the mountain: there they shall offer the sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the abundance of the sea, and of the treasures hid in the sand. 

###### 20 
¶ Also of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he dwelleth as a lion, that catcheth for his prey the arm with the head. 

###### 21 
And he looked to himself at the beginning, because there was a portion of the Law-giver hid: yet he shall come with the heads of the people, to execute the justice of the Lord, and his judgments with Israel. 

###### 22 
¶ And of Dan he said, Dan _is_ a lion's whelp: he shall leap from Bashan. 

###### 23 
¶ Also of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favor, and filled with the blessing of the Lord, possess the West and the South. 

###### 24 
¶ And of Asher he said, Asher _shall be_ blessed with children: he shall be acceptable unto his brethren, and shall dip his foot in oil. 

###### 25 
Thy shoes _shall be_ iron and brass, and thy strength _shall continue_ as long as thou livest. 

###### 26 
¶ There is none like God, O righteous _people_, which rideth upon the heavens for thine help, and on the clouds in his glory. 

###### 27 
The eternal God _is thy_ refuge, and under _his_ arms thou art forever: he shall cast out the enemy before thee, and will say, Destroy _them_. 

###### 28 
Then Israel the fountain of Jacob shall dwell alone in safety in a land of wheat and wine: also his heavens shall drop the dew. 

###### 29 
Blessed art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people saved by the Lord, the shield of thine help, and which is the sword of thy glory? therefore thine enemies shall be in subjection to thee, and thou shalt tread upon their high places.
