###### 1 
Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God and shalt keep that, which he commandeth to be kept: that is, his ordinances, and his laws and his commandments always. 

###### 2 
And consider this day (_for I speak not_ to your children, which have neither known nor seen) the chastisements of the Lord your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm, 

###### 3 
And his signs, and his acts, which he did in the midst of Egypt, unto Pharaoh the King of Egypt and unto all his land: 

###### 4 
And what he did unto the host of the Egyptians, unto their horses, and to their chariots, when he caused the waters of the red Sea to overflow them, as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them unto this day: 

###### 5 
And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place: 

###### 6 
And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab the son of Reuben, when the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them with their households, and their tents, and all their substance that they had in the midst of all Israel. 

###### 7 
For your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did. 

###### 8 
Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments, which I command you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the land whither ye go to possess it: 

###### 9 
Also that ye may prolong _your_ days in the land, which the Lord sware unto your fathers, to give unto them and to their seed, _even_ a land that floweth with milk and honey. 

###### 10 
¶ For the land whither thou goest to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came, where thou sowedst thy seed, and wateredst it with thy feet as a garden of herbs: 

###### 11 
But the land whither ye go to possess it, _is_ a land of mountains and valleys, _and_ drinketh water of the rain of heaven. 

###### 12 
This land doth the Lord thy God care for: the eyes of the Lord thy God _are_ always upon it, from the beginning of the year, even unto the end of the year. 

###### 13 
¶ If ye shall hearken therefore unto my commandments, which I command you this day, that ye love the Lord your God and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul, 

###### 14 
I also will give rain unto your land in due time, the first rain and the latter, that thou mayest gather in thy wheat, and thy wine, and thine oil. 

###### 15 
Also I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou mayest eat, and have enough. 

###### 16 
_But_ beware lest your heart deceive you, and lest ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them. 

###### 17 
And _so_ the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that your land yield not her fruit, and ye perish quickly from the good land, which the Lord giveth you. 

###### 18 
¶ Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they may be as a frontlet between your eyes, 

###### 19 
And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. 

###### 20 
And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thine house, and upon thy gates, 

###### 21 
That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth. 

###### 22 
¶ For if ye keep diligently all these Commandments, which I command you to do: _that is_, to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cleave unto him, 

###### 23 
Then will the Lord cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall possess great nations and mightier than you. 

###### 24 
All the places whereon the soles of your feet shall tread, shall be yours: your coast shall be from the wilderness and from Lebanon, and from the River _even_ the river Perath, unto the uttermost Sea. 

###### 25 
No man shall stand against you: _for_ the Lord your God shall cast the fear and dread of you upon all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto you. 

###### 26 
¶ Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse: 

###### 27 
The blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day: 

###### 28 
And the curse, if ye will not obey the Commandments of the Lord your God, but turn out of the way, which I command you this day, to go after other gods which ye have not known. 

###### 29 
¶ When the Lord thy God therefore hath brought thee into the land, whither thou goest to possess it, then thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse upon mount Ebal. 

###### 30 
Are they not beyond Jordan on that part, where the Sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in the plain over against Gilgal, beside the grove of Moreh? 

###### 31 
For ye shall pass over Jordan, to go in to possess that land which the Lord your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it, and dwell therein. 

###### 32 
Take heed therefore that ye do all the commandments and the laws, which I set before you this day.
