###### 1 
Ye shall keep all the commandments which I command thee this day, for to do them: that ye may live, and be multiplied, and go in, and possess the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers. 

###### 2 
And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee this forty years in the wilderness, for to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no. 

###### 3 
Therefore he humbled thee, and made thee hungry, and fed thee with Manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers know it, that he might teach thee that man lived not by bread only, but by every _word_ that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth a man live. 

###### 4 
Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot swell those forty years. 

###### 5 
Know therefore in thine heart, that as a man nurtureth his son, so the Lord thy God nurtureth thee. 

###### 6 
Therefore shalt thou keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, that thou mayest walk in his ways, and fear him. 

###### 7 
For the Lord thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land in the which are rivers of water and fountains, and depths that spring out of valleys and mountains: 

###### 8 
A land of wheat and barley, and of vineyards, and fig trees, and pomegranates: a land of oil, olive and honey: 

###### 9 
A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarcity, neither shalt thou lack anything therein: a land whose stones _are_ iron, and out of whose mountains thou shalt dig brass. 

###### 10 
And when thou hast eaten and filled thyself, thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land, which he hath given thee. 

###### 11 
Beware that thou forget not the Lord thy God, not keeping his commandments and his laws, and his ordinances, which I command thee this day: 

###### 12 
Lest _when_ thou hast eaten and filled thyself, and hast built goodly houses and dwelt _therein_, 

###### 13 
And thy beasts, and the sheep are increased, and thy silver and gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is increased; 

###### 14 
Then thine heart be lifted up and thou forget the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, 

###### 15 
Who was thy guide in that great and terrible wilderness (_wherein were_ fiery serpents, and scorpions and drought, where _was_ no water, who brought forth water for thee out of the rock of flint: 

###### 16 
Who fed thee in the wilderness with Manna, which thy fathers knew not) to humble thee, and to prove thee, that he might do thee good at the latter end. 

###### 17 
_Beware_ lest thou say in thine heart, My power, and the strength of mine own hand hath prepared me this abundance. 

###### 18 
But remember the Lord thy God: for it is he which giveth thee power to get substance to establish his covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as _appeareth_ this day. 

###### 19 
And if thou forget the Lord thy God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish. 

###### 20 
As the nations which the Lord destroyeth before you, so ye shall perish, because ye would not be obedient unto the voice of the Lord your God.
