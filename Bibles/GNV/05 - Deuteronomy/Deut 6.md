###### 1 
These now are the commandments, ordinances, and laws, which the Lord your God commanded _me_ to teach _you_, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it: 

###### 2 
That thou mightest fear the Lord thy God, and keep all his ordinances, and his commandments which I command thee, thou, and thy son, and thy son's son all the days of thy life, even that thy days may be prolonged: 

###### 3 
Hear therefore, O Israel, and take heed to do it, that it may go well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily in the land that floweth with milk and honey, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath promised thee. 

###### 4 
Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is Lord only, 

###### 5 
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. 

###### 6 
And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart. 

###### 7 
And thou shalt rehearse them continually unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou tarriest in thine house, and as thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up: 

###### 8 
And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes. 

###### 9 
Also thou shalt write them upon the posts of thine house, and upon thy gates. 

###### 10 
And when the Lord thy God hath brought thee into the land, which he sware unto thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give to thee, with great and goodly cities which thou buildedst not, 

###### 11 
And houses full of all manner of goods which thou filledst not, and wells dug which thou dug not, vineyards and olive trees which thou plantedst not, and _when_ thou hast eaten and art full, 

###### 12 
Beware lest thou forget the Lord, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage: 

###### 13 
Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his Name. 

###### 14 
Ye shall not walk after other gods, _after any_ of the gods of the people which are round about you. 

###### 15 
(For the Lord thy God is a jealous God among you:) lest the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy thee from the face of the earth. 

###### 16 
¶ Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God, as ye did tempt him in Massah: 

###### 17 
_But_ ye shall keep diligently the commandments of the Lord your God, and his testimonies and his ordinances, which he hath commanded thee. 

###### 18 
And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of the Lord: that thou mayest prosper, and that thou mayest go in, and possess that good land which the Lord sware unto thy fathers, 

###### 19 
To cast out all thine enemies before thee, as the Lord hath said. 

###### 20 
When thy son shall ask thee in time to come, saying, What mean these testimonies, and ordinances, and Laws, which the Lord our God hath commanded you? 

###### 21 
Then shalt thou say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in Egypt: but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 

###### 22 
And the Lord showed signs and wonders great and evil upon Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household before our eyes, 

###### 23 
And brought us out from thence, to bring us in, and to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers. 

###### 24 
Therefore the Lord hath commanded us, to do all these ordinances, _and_ to fear the Lord our God, that it may go ever well with us, _and_ that he may preserve us alive at this present. 

###### 25 
Moreover, this shall be our righteousness before the Lord our God, if we take heed to keep all these commandments, as he hath commanded us.
