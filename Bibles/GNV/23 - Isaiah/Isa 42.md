###### 1 
Behold, my servant: I will stay upon him: mine elect, _in whom_ my soul delighteth: I have put my Spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. 

###### 2 
He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. 

###### 3 
A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment in truth. 

###### 4 
He shall not fail nor be discouraged till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his Law. 

###### 5 
Thus saith God the Lord (he that created the heavens and spread them abroad: he that stretched forth the earth, and the buds thereof: he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein) 

###### 6 
I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and I will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, _and_ for a light of the Gentiles, 

###### 7 
That thou mayest open the eyes of the blind, _and_ bring out the prisoners from the prison: and them that sit in darkness, out of the prison house. 

###### 8 
I am the Lord, this is my Name, and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images. 

###### 9 
Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they come forth, I tell you of them. 

###### 10 
Sing unto the Lord a new song, _and_ his praise from the end of the earth: ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein, the isles and the inhabitants thereof. 

###### 11 
Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up _their voice_, the towns that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rocks sing: let them shout from the top of the mountains. 

###### 12 
Let them give glory unto the Lord, and declare his praise in the islands. 

###### 13 
The Lord shall go forth as a giant; he shall stir up _his_ courage like a man of war: he shall shout and cry, _and_ shall prevail against his enemies. 

###### 14 
I have a long time held my peace: I have been still _and_ refrained myself; now will I cry like a travailing woman: I will destroy and devour at once. 

###### 15 
I will make waste mountains, and hills, and dry up all their herbs, and I will make the floods islands, and I will dry up the pools. 

###### 16 
¶ And I will bring the blind by a way, that they knew not, _and_ lead them by paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. 

###### 17 
They shall be turned back: they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, and say to the molten images, Ye are our gods. 

###### 18 
¶ Hear, ye deaf: and ye blind, regard, that ye may see. 

###### 19 
Who is blind but my servant? or deaf as my messenger, that I sent? who is blind as the perfect, and blind as the Lord's servant? 

###### 20 
Seeing many things, but thou keepest them not? opening the ears, but he heareth not? 

###### 21 
The Lord is willing for his righteousness sake, _that_ he may magnify the Law and exalt it. 

###### 22 
But this people is robbed and spoiled, and shall be all snared in dungeons, and they shall be hid in prison houses; they shall be for prey, and none shall deliver: a spoil, and none shall say, Restore. 

###### 23 
Who among you shall hearken to this, _and_ take heed, and hear for afterwards? 

###### 24 
Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? Did not the Lord, because we have sinned against him? for they would not walk in his ways, neither be obedient unto his Law. 

###### 25 
Therefore he hath poured upon him his fierce wrath, and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire round about, and he knew not, and it burned him up, yet he considered not.
