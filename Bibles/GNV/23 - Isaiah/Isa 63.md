###### 1 
Who is this that cometh from Edom, with red garments from Bozrah? he is glorious in his apparel, and walketh in his great strength. I speak in righteousness, _and_ am mighty to save. 

###### 2 
Wherefore is thine apparel red, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the winepress? 

###### 3 
I have trodden the winepress alone, and of all people there _was_ none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and tread them under foot in my wrath, and their blood shall be sprinkled upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment. 

###### 4 
For the day of vengeance _is_ in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. 

###### 5 
And I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm helped me, and my wrath itself sustained me. 

###### 6 
Therefore I will tread down the people in my wrath, and make them drunken in mine indignation, and will bring down their strength to the earth. 

###### 7 
I will remember the mercy of the Lord, _and_ the praises of the Lord, according unto all that the Lord hath given us, and for the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he hath given them according to his tender love, and according to his great mercies. 

###### 8 
For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: so he was their Savior. 

###### 9 
In all their troubles he was troubled, and the Angel of his presence saved them: in his love and in his mercy he redeemed them, and he bare them and carried them always continually. 

###### 10 
But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore was he turned to be their enemy, _and_ he fought against them. 

###### 11 
Then he remembered the old time of Moses and his people, saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the shepherd of his sheep? Where is he that put his holy Spirit within him? 

###### 12 
He led _them_ by the right hand of Moses with his own glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting Name. 

###### 13 
He led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness, that they should not stumble. 

###### 14 
As the beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself a glorious Name. 

###### 15 
Look down from heaven, and behold from the dwelling place of thine holiness, and of thy glory. Where is thy zeal and thy strength, the multitude of thy mercies, and of thy compassion? they are restrained from me. 

###### 16 
Doubtless thou art our Father: though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel know us not, _yet_ thou, O Lord, art our Father, _and_ our redeemer: thy Name _is_ forever. 

###### 17 
O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways? _and_ hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servant's sake, _and_ for the tribes of thine inheritance. 

###### 18 
The people of thine holiness have possessed it, but a little while: for our adversaries have trodden down thy Sanctuary. 

###### 19 
We have been _as they_, over whom thou never barest rule, and upon whom thy name was not called.
