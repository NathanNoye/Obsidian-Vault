###### 1 
A vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, _and_ Hezekiah Kings of Judah. 

###### 2 
Hear, O heavens, and hearken, O earth: for the Lord hath said, I have nourished and brought up children, but they have rebelled against me. 

###### 3 
The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: _but_ Israel hath not known: my people hath not understood. 

###### 4 
Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity: a seed of the wicked, corrupt children: they have forsaken the Lord: they have provoked the Holy one of Israel to anger: they are gone backward. 

###### 5 
Wherefore should ye be smitten anymore? for ye fall away more and more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is heavy. 

###### 6 
From the sole of the foot unto the head, there _is_ nothing whole therein, _but_ wounds and swelling, and sores full of corruption: they have not been wrapped, nor bound up nor mollified with oil. 

###### 7 
Your land is waste: your cities _are_ burnt with fire: strangers devour your land in your presence, and _it is_ desolate like the overthrow of strangers. 

###### 8 
And the daughter of Zion shall remain like a cottage in a vineyard, like a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, _and_ like a besieged city. 

###### 9 
Except the Lord of hosts had reserved unto us even a small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, _and_ should have been like unto Gomorrah. 

###### 10 
Hear the word of the Lord, O princes of Sodom: hearken unto the Law of our God, O people of Gomorrah. 

###### 11 
What have I to do with the multitude of your sacrifices, saith the Lord? I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and of the fat of fed beasts: and I desire not the blood of bullocks, nor of lambs, nor of goats. 

###### 12 
When ye come to appear before me, who required this of your hands to tread in my courts? 

###### 13 
Bring no more oblations, in vain: incense is an abomination unto me: I cannot suffer _your_ new moons, nor Sabbath, _nor_ solemn days (_it is_ iniquity) nor solemn assemblies. 

###### 14 
My soul hateth your new moons and your appointed feasts: they are a burden unto me: I am weary to bear _them_. 

###### 15 
And when you shall stretch out your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you: and though ye make many prayers, I will not hear: _for_ your hands are full of blood. 

###### 16 
Wash you, make you clean, take away the evil of your works from before mine eyes: cease to do evil. 

###### 17 
Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed: judge the fatherless, _and_ defend the widow. 

###### 18 
Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins were as crimson, they shall be made white as snow: though they were red like scarlet, they shall be as wool, 

###### 19 
If ye consent and obey, ye shall eat the good _things_ of the land. 

###### 20 
But if ye refuse and be rebellious, ye shall be devoured with the sword: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. 

###### 21 
How is the faithful city become an harlot? it was full of judgment, _and_ justice lodged therein, but now _they are_ murderers. 

###### 22 
Thy silver is become dross: thy wine is mixed with water. 

###### 23 
Thy princes _are_ rebellious, and companions of thieves: every one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the widow's cause come before them. 

###### 24 
Therefore saith the Lord God of hosts, the Mighty one of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies. 

###### 25 
Then I will turn mine hand upon thee, and burn out thy dross, till it be pure, and take away all thy tin. 

###### 26 
And I will restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning: afterward shalt thou be called a city of righteousness, _and_ a faithful city. 

###### 27 
Zion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they that return in her, in justice. 

###### 28 
And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners shall be together: and they that forsake the Lord, shall be consumed. 

###### 29 
For they shall be confounded for the oaks, which ye have desired, and ye shall be ashamed of the gardens that ye have chosen, 

###### 30 
For ye shall be as an oak, whose leaf fadeth: and as a garden that hath no water. 

###### 31 
And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker thereof as a spark: and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench _them_.
