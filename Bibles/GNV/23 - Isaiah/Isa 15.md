###### 1 
The burden of Moab. Surely Ar of Moab was destroyed, _and_ brought to silence in a night: surely Kir of Moab was destroyed, _and_ brought to silence in a night. 

###### 2 
He shall go up to the Temple, and to Dibon to the high places to weep: for Nebo and for Medeba shall Moab howl: upon all their heads _shall be_ baldness, and every beard shaven. 

###### 3 
In their streets shall they be girded with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets everyone shall howl, _and_ come down with weeping. 

###### 4 
And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard unto Jahaz: therefore the warriors of Moab shall shout: the soul of everyone shall lament in himself. 

###### 5 
Mine heart shall cry for Moab: his fugitives _shall flee_ unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for they shall go up with weeping by the mounting up of Luhith: and by the way of Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction. 

###### 6 
For the waters of Nimrim shall be dried up: therefore the grass is withered, the herbs consumed, _and_ there was no green herb. 

###### 7 
Therefore what _every man_ hath left, and their substance shall they bear to the brook of the willows. 

###### 8 
For the cry went round about the borders of Moab, _and_ the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the skriking thereof unto Beer Elim, 

###### 9 
Because the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will bring more upon Dimon, even lions upon him that escapeth of Moab, and to the remnant of the land.
