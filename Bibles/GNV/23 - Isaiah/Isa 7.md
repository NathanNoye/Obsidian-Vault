###### 1 
And in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah king of Judah, Rezin the king of Aram came up, and Pekah the son of Remaliah king of Israel, to Jerusalem to fight against it, but he could not overcome it. 

###### 2 
And it was told the house of David, saying, Aram is joined with Ephraim: therefore his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest are moved by the wind. 

###### 3 
¶ Then said the Lord unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz (thou and Shear-Jashub thy son) at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the path of the fuller's field, 

###### 4 
And say unto him, Take heed, and be still: fear not, neither be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands, for the furious wrath of Rezin and of Aram, and of Remaliah's son, 

###### 5 
Because Aram hath taken wicked counsel against thee, _and_ Ephraim and Remaliah's son, saying, 

###### 6 
Let us go up against Judah, and let us waken them up, and make a breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst thereof, _even_ the son of Tabel. 

###### 7 
Thus saith the Lord God, It shall not stand, neither shall it be. 

###### 8 
For the head of Aram _is_ Damascus, and the head of Damascus _is_ Rezin: and within five and threescore years, Ephraim shall be destroyed from being a people. 

###### 9 
And the head of Ephraim _is_ Samaria, and the head of Samaria _is_ Remaliah's son. If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be established. 

###### 10 
¶ And the Lord spake again unto Ahaz, saying, 

###### 11 
Ask a sign for thee of the Lord thy God: ask it _either_ in the depth beneath, or in the height above. 

###### 12 
But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. 

###### 13 
Then he said, Hear you now, O house of David, is it a small thing for you to grieve men, that ye will also grieve my God? 

###### 14 
Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and she shall call his name Immanuel. 

###### 15 
Butter and honey shall he eat, till he have knowledge to refuse the evil, and to choose the good. 

###### 16 
For afore the child shall have knowledge to eschew the evil, and to choose the good, the land that thou abhorrest, shall be forsaken of both her kings. 

###### 17 
The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy Father's house (the days that are not come from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah) _even_ the King of Assyria. 

###### 18 
And in that day shall the Lord hiss for the fly that is at the uttermost parts of the floods of Egypt, and for the Bee which is in the land of Assyria, 

###### 19 
And they shall come and shall light all in the desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all thorny places, and upon all bushy places. 

###### 20 
In that day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is hired, _even_ by them beyond the River, by the King of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet, and it shall consume the beard. 

###### 21 
And in the same day shall a man nourish a young cow, and two sheep. 

###### 22 
And for the abundance of milk, that they shall give, he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall everyone eat, which is left within the land. 

###### 23 
And at the same day every place, wherein shall be a thousand vines, shall be at a thousand _pieces_ of silver: _so_ it shall be for the briers and for the thorns. 

###### 24 
With arrows and with bow shall one come thither: because all the land shall be briers and thorns. 

###### 25 
But on all the mountains, which shall be dug with the mattock, there shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but they shall be for the sending out of bullocks, and for the treading of sheep.
