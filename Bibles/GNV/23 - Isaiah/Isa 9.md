###### 1 
Yet the darkness shall not _be_ according to the affliction, that it had when at the first he touched lightly the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, nor afterward _when_ he was more grievous by the way of the sea beyond Jordan in Galilee of the Gentiles. 

###### 2 
The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: they that dwelled in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined. 

###### 3 
Thou hast multiplied the nation, _and_ not increased _their_ joy: they have rejoiced before thee according to the joy in harvest, _and_ as men rejoice when they divide a spoil. 

###### 4 
For the yoke of their burden, and the staff of their shoulder, _and_ the rod of their oppressor hast thou broken, as in the day of Midian. 

###### 5 
Surely every battle of the warrior _is_ with noise, and with tumbling of garments in blood: but _this_ shall be with burning, _and_ devouring of fire. 

###### 6 
For unto us a child is born, _and_ unto us a Son is given: and the government is upon his shoulder, and he shall call his name, Wonderful, Counselor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The prince of peace. 

###### 7 
The increase of _his_ government and peace shall have none end: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to stablish it with judgment, and with justice, from henceforth, _even_ forever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. 

###### 8 
¶ The Lord hath sent a word into Jacob, and it lighted upon Israel. 

###### 9 
And all the people shall know, _even_ Ephraim, and the inhabitant of Samaria, that say in the pride and presumption of their heart, 

###### 10 
The bricks are fallen, but we will build it with hewn stones: the wild fig trees are cut down, but we will change them into cedars. 

###### 11 
Nevertheless, the Lord will raise up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together. 

###### 12 
Aram before and the Philistines behind, and they shall devour Israel with open mouth: _yet_ for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand _is_ stretched out still. 

###### 13 
For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of hosts. 

###### 14 
Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day. 

###### 15 
The ancient and the honorable man, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. 

###### 16 
For the leaders of the people cause them to err: and they that are led by them are devoured. 

###### 17 
Therefore shall the Lord have no pleasure in their young men, neither will he have compassion of their fatherless and of their widows: for everyone is an hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth speaketh folly: _yet_ for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand _is_ stretched out still. 

###### 18 
For wickedness burneth as a fire: it devoureth the briers and the thorns, and will kindle in the thick places of the forest: and they shall mount up _like_ the lifting up of smoke. 

###### 19 
By the wrath of the Lord of hosts shall the land be darkened, and the people shall be as the meat of the fire: no man shall spare his brother. 

###### 20 
And he shall snatch at the right hand, and be hungry: and he shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be satisfied: everyone shall eat the flesh of his own arm. 

###### 21 
Manasseh Ephraim: and Ephraim Manasseh, _and_ they both shall be against Judah: _yet_ for all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand _is_ stretched out still.
