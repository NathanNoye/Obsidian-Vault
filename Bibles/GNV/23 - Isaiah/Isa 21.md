###### 1 
The burden of the desert sea. As the whirlwinds in the South used to pass from the wilderness, _so_ shall it come from the horrible land. 

###### 2 
A grievous vision was showed unto me, The Transgressor _against_ a transgressor, and the destroyer _against_ a destroyer. Go up Elam, besiege Media: I have caused all the mourning thereof to cease. 

###### 3 
Therefore are my loins filled with sorrow: sorrows have taken me as the sorrows of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down when I heard it, _and_ I was amazed when I saw it. 

###### 4 
Mine heart failed: fearfulness troubled me: the night of my pleasures hath he turned into fear unto me. 

###### 5 
Prepare thou the table: watch in the watch tower: eat, drink: arise, ye princes, anoint the shield: 

###### 6 
For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, to tell what he seeth. 

###### 7 
And he saw a chariot with two horsemen: a chariot of an ass, _and_ a chariot of a camel: and he hearkened _and_ took diligent heed. 

###### 8 
And he cried, A lion: my Lord, I stand continually upon the watch tower in the daytime, and I am set in my watch every night: 

###### 9 
And behold, this man's chariot cometh with two horsemen. And he answered and said, Babel is fallen: it is fallen, and all the images of her gods hath he broken unto the ground. 

###### 10 
O my threshing, and the corn of my floor. That which I have heard of the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, have I showed unto you. 

###### 11 
¶ The burden of Dumah, he calleth unto me out of Seir, Watchman, what was in the night? Watchman, what was in the night? 

###### 12 
The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night. If ye will as he, inquire: return _and_ come. 

###### 13 
¶ The burden against Arabia. In the forest of Arabia shall ye tarry all night, _even_ in the ways of Dedanites. 

###### 14 
O inhabitants of the land of Tema, bring forth water to meet the thirsty, _and_ prevent him that fleeth with his bread. 

###### 15 
For they flee from the drawn swords, _even_ from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war. 

###### 16 
For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Yet a year according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail. 

###### 17 
And the residue of the number of the strong archers of the sons of Kedar shall be few: for the Lord God of Israel hath spoken it.
