###### 1 
Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name of Israel, and are come out of the waters of Judah: which swear by the name of the Lord, and make mention of the God of Israel, _but_ not in truth nor in righteousness. 

###### 2 
For they are called of the holy city, and stay themselves upon the God of Israel, whose Name _is_ the Lord of hosts. 

###### 3 
I have declared the former things of old, and they went out of my mouth, and I showed them: I did them suddenly and they came to pass. 

###### 4 
Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck _is_ an iron sinew, and thy brow brass, 

###### 5 
Therefore I have declared it to thee of old: before it came to pass, I showed it thee, lest thou shouldest say, Mine idol hath done them, and my carved image, and my molten image hath commanded them. 

###### 6 
Thou hast heard, behold all this, and will not ye declare it? I have showed thee new things, even now, and hid things, which thou knewest not. 

###### 7 
They are created now, and not of old, and even before this thou heardest them not, lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I knew them. 

###### 8 
Yet thou heardest them not, neither didst know them, neither yet was thine ear opened of old; for I knew that thou wouldest grievously transgress: therefore have I called thee a transgressor from the womb. 

###### 9 
For my Name's sake will I defer my wrath, and for my praise, will I refrain it from thee, that I cut thee not off. 

###### 10 
Behold, I have fined thee, but not as silver: I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction. 

###### 11 
For mine own sake, for mine own sake will I do it; for how should _my Name_ be polluted? surely I will not give my glory unto another. 

###### 12 
Hear me, O Jacob and Israel, my called, I am, I am the first, and I am the last. 

###### 13 
Surely mine hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call them, they stand up together. 

###### 14 
All you, assemble yourselves, and hear: which among them hath declared these things? The Lord hath loved him, he will do his will in Babel, and his arm _shall be_ against the Chaldeans. 

###### 15 
I, _even_ I have spoken it, and I have called him, I have brought him, and his way shall prosper. 

###### 16 
Come near unto me: hear ye this: I have not spoken it in secret from the beginning: from the time that the thing was, I was there, and now the Lord God and his Spirit hath sent me. 

###### 17 
Thus saith the Lord thy redeemer, the Holy one of Israel, I am the Lord thy God, which teach thee to profit, and lead thee by the way that thou shouldest go. 

###### 18 
Oh, that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy prosperity been as the flood, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea. 

###### 19 
Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the fruit of thy body like the gravel thereof: his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed before me. 

###### 20 
Go ye out of Babel: flee ye from the Chaldeans with a voice of joy: tell and declare this: show it forth to the end of the earth: say ye, The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob. 

###### 21 
And they were not thirsty: he led them through the wilderness: he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: for he clave the rock and the water gushed out. 

###### 22 
There is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.
