###### 1 
The burden of Tyre. Howl ye ships of Tarshish: for it is destroyed, so that there is none house: none shall come from the land of Kittim: it is revealed unto them. 

###### 2 
Be still, ye that dwell in the isles: the merchants of Sidon, _and_ such as pass over the sea, have replenished thee. 

###### 3 
The seed of Nile _growing_ by the abundance of waters, _and_ the harvest of the river _was_ her revenues, and she was a mart of the nations. 

###### 4 
Be ashamed, thou Sidon: for the sea hath spoken, _even_ the strength of the sea, saying, I have not travailed, nor brought forth children, neither nourished young men, _nor_ brought up virgins. 

###### 5 
When the fame cometh to the Egyptians, they shall be sorry, concerning the rumor of Tyre. 

###### 6 
Go you over to Tarshish: howl, ye that dwell in the isles. 

###### 7 
Is not this that your glorious _city_? her antiquity _is_ of ancient days: her own feet shall lead her afar off to be a sojourner. 

###### 8 
Who hath decreed this against Tyre (that crowneth _men_) whose merchants _are_ princes? whose chapmen _are_ the nobles of the world? 

###### 9 
The Lord of hosts hath decreed this, to stain the pride of all glory, and to bring to contempt all them that be glorious in the earth. 

###### 10 
Pass through thy land like a flood _to_ the daughter of Tarshish: there is no more strength. 

###### 11 
He stretched out his hand upon the sea: he shook the kingdoms: the Lord hath given a commandment concerning the place of merchandise, to destroy the power thereof. 

###### 12 
And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice when thou art oppressed: O virgin daughter of Sidon: rise up, go out unto Kittim: yet there thou shalt have no rest. 

###### 13 
Behold the land of the Chaldeans: this was no people: Assyria founded it by the inhabitants of the wilderness: they set up the towers thereof: they raised the palaces thereof, _and_ he brought it to ruin. 

###### 14 
Howl ye ships of Tarshish, for your strength is destroyed. 

###### 15 
And in that day shall Tyre be forgotten seventy years (according to the years of one King) at the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot. 

###### 16 
Take an harp _and_ go about the city (thou harlot that hast been forgotten) make sweet melody, sing more songs that thou mayest be remembered. 

###### 17 
And at the end of seventy years shall the Lord visit Tyre, and she shall return to her wages, and shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the earth, _that are_ in the world. 

###### 18 
Yet her occupying and her wages shall be holy unto the Lord: it shall not be laid up nor kept in store, but her merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the Lord, to eat sufficiently, and to have durable clothing.
