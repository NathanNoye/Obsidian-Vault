###### 1 
The desert and the wilderness shall rejoice, and the waste ground shall be glad and flourish as the rose. 

###### 2 
It shall flourish abundantly, and shall greatly rejoice also and joy: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it: the beauty of Carmel, and of Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, _and_ the excellency of our God. 

###### 3 
Strengthen the weak hands, and comfort the feeble knees. 

###### 4 
Say unto them that are fearful, Be you strong, fear not: behold, your God cometh with vengeance: _even_ God with a recompense, he will come and save you. 

###### 5 
Then shall the eyes of the blind be lightened, and the ears of the deaf be opened. 

###### 6 
Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the dumb man's tongue shall sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and rivers in the desert. 

###### 7 
And the dry ground shall be as a pool, and the thirsty as springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where they lay,_ shall be_ a place for reeds and rushes. 

###### 8 
And there shall be a path and a way, and the way shall be called holy: the polluted shall not pass by it: for he shall be with them, and walk in the way, and the fools shall not err. 

###### 9 
There shall be no lion, nor noisome beasts shall ascend by it, neither shall they be found there, that the redeemed may walk. 

###### 10 
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with praise: and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away.
