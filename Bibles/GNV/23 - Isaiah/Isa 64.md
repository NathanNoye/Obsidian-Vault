###### 1 
Oh, that thou wouldest break the heavens, _and_ come down, _and_ that the mountains might melt at thy presence! 

###### 2 
As the melting fire burned, _as_ the fire caused the waters to boil, (that thou mightest declare thy Name to thine adversaries) the people did tremble at thy presence. 

###### 3 
When thou didst terrible things, which we looked not for, thou camest down, _and_ the mountains melted at thy presence. 

###### 4 
For since the beginning of the world, they have not heard nor understood with the ear, neither hath the eye seen _another_ God beside thee, which doeth _so_ to him that waiteth for him. 

###### 5 
Thou didst meet him, that rejoiced _in thee_, and did justly: they remembered thee in thy ways: behold, thou art angry, for we have sinned: _yet_ in them _is_ continuance, and we shall be saved. 

###### 6 
But we have all been as an unclean thing, and all our righteousness _is_ as filthy cloths, and we all do fade like a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away. 

###### 7 
And there _is_ none that calleth upon thy Name, neither that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us because of our iniquities. 

###### 8 
But now, O Lord, thou art our Father: we are the clay, and thou art our potter, and we all are the work of thine hands. 

###### 9 
Be not angry, O Lord, above measure, neither remember iniquity forever: Lo, we beseech thee, behold, we are all thy people. 

###### 10 
Thine holy cities lie waste: Zion is a wilderness, _and_ Jerusalem a desert. 

###### 11 
The house of our Sanctuary, and of our glory, where our fathers praised thee, is burnt up with fire, and all our pleasant things are wasted. 

###### 12 
Wilt thou hold thyself still at these things, O Lord? wilt thou hold thy peace and afflict us above measure?
