###### 1 
Woe to thee that spoilest, and wast not spoiled: and doest wickedly, and they did not wickedly against thee: when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled: when thou shalt make an end of doing wickedly, they shall do wickedly against thee. 

###### 2 
O Lord, have mercy upon us, we have waited for thee: be thou, _which wast_ their arm in the morning, our help also in time of trouble. 

###### 3 
At the noise of the tumult, the people fled: at thine exalting the nations were scattered. 

###### 4 
And your spoil shall be gathered _like_ the gathering of caterpillars: and he shall go against him like the leaping of grasshoppers. 

###### 5 
The Lord is exalted: for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and justice. 

###### 6 
And there shall be stability of the times, strength, salvation, wisdom, and knowledge: _for_ the fear of the Lord shall be his treasure. 

###### 7 
Behold, their messengers shall cry without, and the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly. 

###### 8 
The paths are waste: the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant: he hath contemned the cities: he regardeth no man. 

###### 9 
The earth mourneth and fainteth: Lebanon is ashamed, and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness, and Bashan is shaken and Carmel. 

###### 10 
Now will I arise, saith the Lord: now will I be exalted, now will I lift up myself. 

###### 11 
Ye shall conceive chaff, _and_ bring forth stubble: the fire of your breath shall devour you. 

###### 12 
And the people shall be _as_ the burning of lime: _and as_ the thorns cut up, shall they be burnt in the fire. 

###### 13 
Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done, and ye that are near, know my power. 

###### 14 
The sinners in Zion are afraid: a fear is come upon the hypocrites: who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with the everlasting burnings? 

###### 15 
He that walketh in justice, and speaketh righteous things, refusing gain of oppression, shaking his hands from taking of gifts, stopping his ears from hearing of blood, and shutting his eyes from seeing evil, 

###### 16 
He shall dwell on high: his defense _shall be_ the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him, _and_ his waters shall be sure. 

###### 17 
Thine eyes shall see the King in his glory: they shall behold the land far off. 

###### 18 
Thine heart shall meditate fear, Where is the scribe? where is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers? 

###### 19 
Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a dark speech, that thou canst not perceive, _and_ of a stammering tongue that thou canst not understand. 

###### 20 
Look upon Zion the city of our solemn feasts: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be removed: and the stakes thereof can never be taken away, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken. 

###### 21 
For surely there the mighty Lord _will be_ unto us, _as_ a place of floods, _and_ broad rivers, whereby shall pass no ship with oars, neither shall great ship pass thereby. 

###### 22 
For the Lord _is_ our Judge, the Lord _is_ our lawgiver: the Lord _is_ our King, he will save us. 

###### 23 
Thy cords are loosed: they could not well strengthen their mast, neither could they spread the sail: then shall the prey be divided for a great spoil: _yea_, the lame shall take away the prey. 

###### 24 
And none inhabitant shall say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein, shall have their iniquity forgiven.
