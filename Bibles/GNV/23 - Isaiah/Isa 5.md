###### 1 
Now will I sing to my beloved a song of my beloved to his vineyard, My beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill. 

###### 2 
And he hedged it, and gathered out the stones of it, and he planted it with the best plants, and he built a tower in the midst thereof, and made a winepress therein, then he looked that it should bring forth grapes: but it brought forth wild grapes. 

###### 3 
Now therefore, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard. 

###### 4 
What could I have done anymore to my vineyard that I have not done unto it? why have I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it bringeth forth wild grapes? 

###### 5 
And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up: I will break the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down: 

###### 6 
And I will lay it waste: it shall not be cut, nor dug, but briers and thorns shall grow up: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. 

###### 7 
¶ Surely the vineyard of the Lord of hosts _is_ the house of Israel, and the men of Judah _are_ his pleasant plant, and he looked for judgment, but behold oppression: for righteousness, but behold a crying. 

###### 8 
Woe unto them that join house to house, _and_ lay field to field, till there be no place, that ye may be placed by yourselves in the midst of the earth. 

###### 9 
_This is_ in mine ears, _saith_ the Lord of hosts. Surely many houses shall be desolate, _even_ great and fair without inhabitant. 

###### 10 
For ten acres of vines shall yield one bath, and the seed of an homer shall yield an ephah. 

###### 11 
¶ Woe unto them, that rise up early to follow drunkenness, and to them that continue until night, _till_ the wine do inflame them, 

###### 12 
And the harp and viol, timbrel and pipe, and wine _are_ in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the work of his hands. 

###### 13 
Therefore my people is gone into captivity, because they had no knowledge, and the glory thereof _are_ men famished, and the multitude thereof is dried up with thirst. 

###### 14 
Therefore hell hath enlarged itself, and hath opened his mouth without measure, and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, shall descend _into it_. 

###### 15 
And man shall be brought down, and man shall be humbled, even the eyes of the proud shall be humbled. 

###### 16 
And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified in justice. 

###### 17 
Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the strangers shall eat the desolate places of the fat. 

###### 18 
¶ Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin, as with cart ropes: 

###### 19 
Which say, Let him make speed: let him hasten his work, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it. 

###### 20 
Woe unto them that speak good of evil, and evil of good, which put darkness for light, and light for darkness, that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for sour. 

###### 21 
Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight. 

###### 22 
Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and unto them that are strong to pour in strong drink: 

###### 23 
Which justify the wicked for a reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him. 

###### 24 
Therefore as the flame of fire devoureth the stubble, and _as_ the chaff is consumed of the flame: _so_ their root shall be a rottenness, and their bud shall rise up like dust, because they have cast off the Law of the Lord of hosts, and contemned the word of the Holy one of Israel. 

###### 25 
Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and hath smitten them that the mountains did tremble: and their carcasses were torn in the midst of the streets, _and_ for all this his wrath was not turned away, but his hand was stretched out still. 

###### 26 
And he will lift up a sign unto the nations afar, and will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and behold, they shall come hastily with speed. 

###### 27 
None shall faint nor fall among them: none shall slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of his loins be loosed, nor the latchet of his shoes be broken. 

###### 28 
Whose arrows shall be sharp, and all his bows bent: his horse hoofs shall be thought like flint, and his wheels like whirlwind. 

###### 29 
His roaring _shall be_ like a lion, and he shall roar like lion's whelps: they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey: they shall take it away, and none shall deliver it. 

###### 30 
And in that day they shall roar upon them, as the roaring of the sea: and if they look unto the earth, behold darkness _and_ sorrow, and the light shall be darkened in their sky.
