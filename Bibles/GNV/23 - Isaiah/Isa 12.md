###### 1 
And thou shalt say in that day, O Lord, I will praise thee: though thou wast angry with me, thy wrath is turned away, and thou comfortest me. 

###### 2 
Behold, God _is_ my salvation: I will trust, and will not fear: for the Lord God _is_ my strength and song: he is also become my salvation. 

###### 3 
Therefore with joy shall ye draw waters out of the wells of salvation. 

###### 4 
And ye shall say in that day, Praise the Lord: call upon his Name: declare his works among the people: make mention of them, for his Name is exalted. 

###### 5 
Sing unto the Lord, for he hath done excellent things: this is known in all the world. 

###### 6 
Cry out, and shout, O inhabitant of Zion: for great _is_ the Holy one of Israel in the midst of thee.
