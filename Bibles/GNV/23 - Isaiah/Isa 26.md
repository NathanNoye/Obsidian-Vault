###### 1 
In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah, We have a strong city: salvation shall _God_ set for walls and bulwarks. 

###### 2 
Open ye the gates that the righteous nation, which keepeth the truth, may enter in. 

###### 3 
By an assured purpose wilt thou preserve perfect peace, because they trusted in thee. 

###### 4 
Trust in the Lord forever: for in the Lord God _is_ strength forevermore. 

###### 5 
For he will bring down them that dwell on high: the high city he will abase: _even_ unto the ground will he cast it down, and bring it unto dust. 

###### 6 
The foot shall tread it down, _even_ the feet of the poor, _and_ the steps of the needy. 

###### 7 
The way of the just _is_ righteousness: thou wilt make equal the righteous path of the just. 

###### 8 
Also we, O Lord, have waited for thee in the way of thy judgments: the desire of _our_ soul _is_ to thy Name, and to the remembrance of thee. 

###### 9 
With my soul have I desired thee in the night, and with my spirit within me will I seek thee in the morning: for seeing thy judgments _are_ in the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn righteousness. 

###### 10 
Let mercy be showed to the wicked, _yet_ he will not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he do wickedly, and will not behold the majesty of the Lord. 

###### 11 
O Lord, they will not behold thine high hand: _but_ they shall see it, and be confounded with the zeal of the people, and the fire of thine enemies shall devour them. 

###### 12 
Lord unto us thou wilt ordain peace: for thou also hast wrought all our works for us. 

###### 13 
O Lord our God, _other_ lords beside thee, have ruled us, _but_ we will remember thee only, _and_ thy Name. 

###### 14 
The dead shall not live, _neither_ shall the dead arise, because thou hast visited and scattered them, and destroyed all their memory. 

###### 15 
Thou hast increased the nation, O Lord: thou hast increased the nation: thou art made glorious, thou hast enlarged all the coasts of the earth. 

###### 16 
Lord, in trouble have they visited thee: they poured out a prayer when thy chastening _was_ upon them. 

###### 17 
Like as a woman with child, that draweth near to the travail, is in sorrow, _and_ crieth in her pains, so have we been in thy sight, O Lord. 

###### 18 
We have conceived, we have born in pain, as though we should have brought forth wind: there was no help in the earth, neither did the inhabitants of the world fall. 

###### 19 
¶ Thy dead men shall live: _even_ with my body shall they rise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew _is_ as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead. 

###### 20 
Come, my people: enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors after thee: hide thyself for a very little while, until the indignation pass over. 

###### 21 
For lo, the Lord cometh out of his place, to visit the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them: and the earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more hide her slain.
