###### 1 
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, will your God say. 

###### 2 
Speak comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she hath received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins. 

###### 3 
A voice crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord: make straight in the desert a path for our God. 

###### 4 
Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low; and the crooked shall be straight, and the rough places plain. 

###### 5 
And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. 

###### 6 
A voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh _is_ grass, and all the grace thereof _is_ as the flowers of the field. 

###### 7 
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth, because the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: surely the people _is_ grass. 

###### 8 
The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand forever. 

###### 9 
¶ O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high mountain: O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength: lift it up, be not afraid: say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God. 

###### 10 
Behold, the Lord God will come with power, and his arm shall rule for him: behold, his reward _is_ with him, and his work before him. 

###### 11 
He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, _and_ shall guide them with young. 

###### 12 
Who hath measured the waters in his fist? and counted heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure? and weighed the mountains in a weight, and the hills in a balance? 

###### 13 
Who hath instructed the spirit of the Lord? or _was_ his counselor, _or_ taught him? 

###### 14 
Of whom took the counsel, and _who_ instructed him and taught him in the way of judgment? or taught him knowledge, and showed unto him the way of understanding? 

###### 15 
Behold, the nations _are_ as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the dust of the balance: behold, he taketh away the isles as a little dust. 

###### 16 
And Lebanon _is_ not sufficient for fire, nor the beasts thereof sufficient for a burnt offering. 

###### 17 
All nations before him _are_ as nothing, and they are counted to him, less than nothing, and vanity. 

###### 18 
To whom then will ye liken God? or what similitude will ye set up unto him? 

###### 19 
The workman melteth an image, or the goldsmith beateth it out in gold, or the goldsmith _maketh_ silver plates. 

###### 20 
Doth not the poor choose out a tree that will not rot, for an oblation? he seeketh also unto him a cunning workman, to prepare an image that shall not be moved. 

###### 21 
Know ye nothing? have ye not heard it? hath it not been told you from the beginning? have ye not understood it by the foundation of the earth? 

###### 22 
He sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof _are_ as grasshoppers, he stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out, as a tent to dwell in. 

###### 23 
He bringeth the princes to nothing, _and_ maketh the judges of the earth, as vanity, 

###### 24 
As though they were not planted, as though they were not sown, as though their stock took no root in the earth: for he did even blow upon them, and they withered, and the whirlwind will take them away as stubble. 

###### 25 
To whom now will ye liken me, that I should be like _him_, saith the Holy one? 

###### 26 
Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, and bringeth out their armies by number, and calleth them all by names: by the greatness of _his_ power and mighty strength nothing faileth. 

###### 27 
Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest O Israel, My way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is passed over of my God? 

###### 28 
Knowest thou not? _or_ hast thou not heard, that the everlasting God, the Lord hath created the ends of the earth? he neither fainteth, nor is weary: there _is_ no searching of his understanding. 

###### 29 
_But_ he giveth strength unto him that fainteth, and unto him that hath no strength, he increaseth power. 

###### 30 
Even the young men shall faint, and be weary, and the young men shall stumble and fall. 

###### 31 
But they that wait upon the Lord, shall renew _their_ strength: they shall lift up the wings, as the eagles: they shall run, and not be weary, and they shall walk and not faint.
