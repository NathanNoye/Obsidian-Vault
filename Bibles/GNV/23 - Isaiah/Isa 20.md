###### 1 
In the year that Tartan came to Ashdod, (when Sargon king of Assyria sent him) and had fought against Ashdod, and taken it, 

###### 2 
At the same time spake the Lord by the hand of Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go, and loose the sackcloth from thy loins, and put off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and barefoot. 

###### 3 
And the Lord said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years _as_ a sign and wonder upon Egypt, and Ethiopia, 

###### 4 
So shall the king of Assyria take away the captivity of Egypt, and the captivity of Ethiopia, _both_ young men and old men, naked and barefoot, with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. 

###### 5 
And they shall fear, and be ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory. 

###### 6 
Then shall the inhabitants of this isle say in that day, Behold, such is our expectation, whither we fled for help to be delivered from the king of Assyria, and how shall we be delivered?
