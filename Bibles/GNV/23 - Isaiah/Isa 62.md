###### 1 
For Zion's sake I will not hold my tongue, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof break forth as the light, and salvation thereof as a burning lamp. 

###### 2 
And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all Kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the Lord shall name. 

###### 3 
Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 

###### 4 
It shall no more be said unto thee, Forsaken, neither shall it be said anymore to thy land, Desolate, but thou shalt be called Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy land shalt have an husband. 

###### 5 
For _as_ a young man marrieth a virgin, _so _shall thy sons marry thee: and _as_ a bridegroom is glad of the bride, _so_ shall thy God rejoice over thee. 

###### 6 
I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which all the day and all the night continual shall not cease: ye that are mindful of the Lord, keep not silence, 

###### 7 
And give him no rest, till he repair, and until he set up Jerusalem the praise of the world. 

###### 8 
The Lord hath sworn by his right hand and by his strong arm, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies, and surely the sons of the strangers shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast labored. 

###### 9 
But they that have gathered it, shall eat it, and praise the Lord, and the gatherers thereof shall drink it in the courts of my Sanctuary. 

###### 10 
Go through, go through the gates: prepare you the way for the people: cast up, cast up the way, and gather out the stones, _and_ set up a standard for the people. 

###### 11 
Behold, the Lord hath proclaimed unto the ends of the world, tell the daughter Zion, Behold, thy Savior cometh: Behold, his wages _is_ with him, and his work _is_ before him. 

###### 12 
And they shall call them, The holy people, the redeemed of the Lord, and thou shalt be named, A city sought out _and_ not forsaken.
