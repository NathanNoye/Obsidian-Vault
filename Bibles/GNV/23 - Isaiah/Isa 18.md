###### 1 
Oh, the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the rivers of Ethiopia, 

###### 2 
Sending ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of reeds upon the waters, _saying_, Go, ye swift messengers, to a nation that is scattered abroad, and spoiled, unto a terrible people from their beginning even hitherto: a nation by little and little even trodden under foot: whose land the floods have spoiled. 

###### 3 
All ye the inhabitants of the world, and dwellers in the earth, shall see when he setteth up a sign in the mountains, and when he bloweth the trumpet, ye shall hear. 

###### 4 
For so the Lord said unto me, I will rest and behold in my tabernacle, as the heat drying up the rain, _and_ as a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest. 

###### 5 
For afore the harvest, when the flour is finished, and the fruit is ripening in the flour, then he shall cut down the branches with hooks, and shall take away, _and_ cut off the boughs: 

###### 6 
They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains, and to the beasts of the earth: for the fowl shall summer upon it, and every beast of the earth shall winter upon it. 

###### 7 
At that time shall a present be brought unto the Lord of hosts (a people that is scattered abroad, and spoiled, and of a terrible people from their beginning hitherto, a nation by little and little even trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled) to the place of the name of the Lord of hosts, _even_ the mount Zion.
