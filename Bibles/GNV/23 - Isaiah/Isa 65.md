###### 1 
I have been sought of them that asked not: I was found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a nation that called not upon my Name. 

###### 2 
I have spread out mine hands all the day unto a rebellious people, which walked in a way that was not good, _even_ after their own imaginations. 

###### 3 
A people that provoked me ever unto my face: that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon bricks. 

###### 4 
Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the deserts, which eat swine's flesh, and the broth of things polluted _are_ in their vessels. 

###### 5 
Which say, Stand apart, come not near to me; for I am holier than thou; these are a smoke in my wrath, _and_ a fire that burneth all the day. 

###### 6 
Behold, it is written before me; I will not keep silence, but will render it and recompense it into their bosom. 

###### 7 
Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers, _shall be_ together (saith the Lord) which have burnt incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills; therefore will I measure their old work into their bosom. 

###### 8 
Thus saith the Lord, As the wine is found in the cluster, and one saith, Destroy it not, for a blessing _is_ in it, so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them whole. 

###### 9 
But I will bring a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah that shall inherit my mountain; and mine elect shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there. 

###### 10 
And Sharon shall be a sheepfold, and the valley of Achor shall be a resting place for the cattle of my people, that have sought me. 

###### 11 
But ye are they that have forsaken the Lord, and forgotten mine holy Mountain, and have prepared a table for the multitude, and furnish the drink offerings unto the number. 

###### 12 
Therefore will I number you to the sword, and all you shall bow down to the slaughter, because I called, and ye did not answer; I spake, and ye heard not, but did evil in my sight, and did choose that thing which I would not. 

###### 13 
Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Behold, my servants shall eat, and ye shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, and ye shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, and ye shall be ashamed. 

###### 14 
Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, and ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of mind. 

###### 15 
And ye shall leave your name as a curse unto my chosen; for the Lord God shall slay you, and call his servants by another name. 

###### 16 
He that shall bless in the earth, shall bless himself in the true God; and he that sweareth in the earth, shall swear by the true God; for the former troubles are forgotten, and shall surely hide themselves from mine eyes. 

###### 17 
For lo, I will create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind. 

###### 18 
But be you glad and rejoice forever in the things that I shall create; for behold, I will create Jerusalem, _as_ a rejoicing, and her people _as_ a joy. 

###### 19 
And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice of crying. 

###### 20 
There shall be no more there a child of years, nor an old man that hath not filled his days: for he that shall be an hundred years old, shall die _as_ a young man: but the sinner being an hundred years old shall be accursed. 

###### 21 
And they shall build houses, and inhabit them, and they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 

###### 22 
They shall not build, and another inhabit: they shall not plant, and another eat: for as the days of the tree are the days of my people, and mine elect shall enjoy in old age the work of their hands. 

###### 23 
They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth in fear: for they are the seed of the blessed of the Lord, and their buds with them. 

###### 24 
Yea, before they call, I will answer, and whiles they speak, I will hear. 

###### 25 
The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock: and to the serpent dust _shall be_ his meat. They shall no more hurt nor destroy in all mine holy Mountain, saith the Lord.
