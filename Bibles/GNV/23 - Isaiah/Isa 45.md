###### 1 
Thus saith the Lord unto Cyrus his anointed, whose right hand I have holden to subdue nations before him: therefore will I weaken the loins of kings, and open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut. 

###### 2 
I will go before thee, and make the crooked straight: I will break the brazen doors, and burst the iron bars. 

###### 3 
And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and the things hid in secret places, that thou mayest know that I am the Lord which call thee by thy name, even the God of Israel. 

###### 4 
For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I will even call _thee_ by thy name, _and_ name thee, though thou hast not known me. 

###### 5 
I am the Lord, and there is none other; there is no God besides me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me. 

###### 6 
That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the West, that there is none besides me. I am the Lord, and there is none other. 

###### 7 
I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things. 

###### 8 
Ye heavens send the dew from above, and let the clouds drop down righteousness: let the earth open, and let salvation and justice grow forth: let it bring them forth together: I the Lord have created him. 

###### 9 
Woe be unto him that striveth with his maker, the potsherd with the potsherds of the earth: shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, It hath none hands? 

###### 10 
Woe unto him that saith to _his_ father, What hast thou begotten? or to _his_ mother, What hast thou brought forth? 

###### 11 
Thus saith the Lord, the only one of Israel, and his maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the works of mine hands: commend you me. 

###### 12 
I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, whose hands have spread out the heavens, I have even commanded all their army. 

###### 13 
I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, saith the Lord of hosts. 

###### 14 
Thus saith the Lord, The labor of Egypt, and the merchandise of Ethiopia, and of the Sabeans, men of stature shall come unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall follow thee, _and_ shall go in chains: they shall fall down before thee, and make supplication unto thee, _saying_, Surely God is in thee, and there _is_ none other God besides. 

###### 15 
Verily, thou O God hidest thyself, O God, the Savior of Israel. 

###### 16 
All they shall be ashamed and also confounded: they shall go to confusion together, that are the makers of images. 

###### 17 
_But_ Israel shall be saved in the Lord, with an everlasting salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world without end. 

###### 18 
For this saith the Lord (that created heaven, God himself that formed the earth, and made it: he that prepared it, he created it not in vain: he formed it to be inhabited) I am the Lord, and there _is_ none other. 

###### 19 
I have not spoken in secret, _neither_ in a place of darkness in the earth: I said not in vain unto the seed of Jacob, Seek you me: I the Lord do speak righteousness, and declare righteous things. 

###### 20 
Assemble yourselves, and come: draw near together, ye abject of the Gentiles: they have no knowledge, that set up the wood of their idol, and pray unto a god, that cannot save them. 

###### 21 
Tell ye and bring them, and let them take counsel together, who hath declared this from the beginning, _or_ hath told it of old? Have not I the Lord? and there _is_ none other God beside me, a just God, and a Savior: there _is_ none beside me. 

###### 22 
Look unto me, and ye shall be saved: all the ends of the earth shall be saved: for I am God, and there _is_ none other. 

###### 23 
I have sworn by myself: the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That every knee shall bow unto me, _and_ every tongue shall swear _by me_. 

###### 24 
Surely he shall say, In the Lord have I righteousness and strength: he shall come unto him, and all that provoke him shall be ashamed. 

###### 25 
The whole seed of Israel shall be justified, and glory in the Lord.
