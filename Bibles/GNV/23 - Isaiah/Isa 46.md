###### 1 
Bel is bowed down: Nebo is fallen: their idols were upon their beasts, and upon the cattle: they which did bear you, _were_ laden with a weary burden. 

###### 2 
They are bowed down, _and_ fallen together, for they could not rid them of the burden, and their soul is gone into captivity. 

###### 3 
Hear ye me, O house of Jacob, and all that remain of the house of Israel, which are born of me _from_ the womb, and brought up of me _from_ the birth. 

###### 4 
Therefore unto old age, I the same, even I will bear _you_ until the hoary hairs: I have made _you_: I will also bear _you_, and I will carry _you_, and I will deliver _you_. 

###### 5 
¶ To whom will ye make me like, or make me equal, or compare me that I should be like him? 

###### 6 
They draw gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, _and_ hire a goldsmith to make a god of it, _and_ they bow down and worship it. 

###### 7 
They bear it upon the shoulders: they carry him and set him in his place: so doth he stand, _and_ cannot remove from his place. Though one cry unto him, yet can he not answer, nor deliver him out of his tribulation. 

###### 8 
Remember this, and be ashamed: bring it again to mind, O you transgressors. 

###### 9 
Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there _is_ none other God, and there _is_ nothing like me, 

###### 10 
Which declare the last thing from the beginning, and from of old: the things that were not done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do whatsoever I will. 

###### 11 
I call a bird from the East, _and_ the man of my counsel from far: as I have spoken, so will I bring it to pass: I have purposed it, and I will do it. 

###### 12 
Hear me ye stubborn hearted, that are far from justice. 

###### 13 
I bring near my justice: it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry: for I will give salvation in Zion, _and_ my glory unto Israel.
