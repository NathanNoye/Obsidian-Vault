###### 1 
The righteous perisheth, and no man considereth it in heart, and merciful men are taken away, and no man understandeth that the righteous is taken away from the evil _to come_. 

###### 2 
Peace shall come: they shall rest in their beds, _everyone_ that walketh before him. 

###### 3 
But you witches' children, come hither, the seed of the adulterer and of the whore. 

###### 4 
On whom have ye jested? upon whom have ye gaped and thrust out your tongue? are not ye rebellious children, _and_ a false seed? 

###### 5 
Inflamed with idols under every green tree? and sacrificing the children in the valleys under the tops of the rocks? 

###### 6 
Thy portion _is_ in the smooth stones of the river: they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink offering: thou hast offered a sacrifice. Should I delight in these? 

###### 7 
Thou hast made thy bed upon a very high mountain: thou wentest up thither, even thither wentest thou to offer sacrifice. 

###### 8 
Behind the doors also and posts hast thou set up thy remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself _to another_, than me, and wentest up, _and_ didst enlarge thy bed, and make a covenant between thee and them, and lovedst their bed in _every_ place where thou sawest it. 

###### 9 
Thou wentest to the kings with oil, and didst increase thine ointments, _and_ send thy messengers far off, and didst humble thyself unto hell. 

###### 10 
Thou weariedst thyself in thy manifold journeys, _yet_ saidest thou not, There is no hope: thou hast found life by thine hand, therefore thou wast not grieved. 

###### 11 
And whom didst thou reverence or fear, seeing thou hast lied unto me, and hast not remembered me, neither set thy mind thereon? is it not _because_ I hold my peace, and that of long time? therefore thou fearest not me. 

###### 12 
I will declare thy righteousness and thy works, and they shall not profit thee. 

###### 13 
When thou cryest, let them that thou hast gathered together, deliver thee: but the wind shall take them all away: vanity shall pull them away: but he that trusteth in me shall inherit the land, and shall possess mine holy Mountain. 

###### 14 
And he shall say, Cast up, cast up: prepare the way: take up the stumbling blocks out of the way of my people. 

###### 15 
For thus saith he that is high and excellent, he that inhabiteth the eternity, whose Name is the Holy one, I dwell in the high and holy place: with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble, and to give life to them that are of a contrite heart. 

###### 16 
For I will not contend forever: neither will I be always wroth, for the spirit should fail before me: and I have made the breath. 

###### 17 
For his wicked covetousness I am angry with him, and have smitten him: I hid me, and was angry, yet he went away, and turned after the way of his own heart. 

###### 18 
I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comfort unto him, and to those that lament him. 

###### 19 
I create the fruit of the lips, _to be_ peace: peace unto them that are far off, and to them that are near, saith the Lord: for I will heal him. 

###### 20 
But the wicked _are_ like the raging sea, that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. 

###### 21 
There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.
