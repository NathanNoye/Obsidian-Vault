###### 1 
The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from being a city, for it shall be a ruinous heap. 

###### 2 
The cities of Aroer _shall be_ forsaken: they shall be for the flocks: for they shall lie _there_, and none shall make them afraid. 

###### 3 
The munition also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom from Damascus, and the remnant of Aram shall be as the glory of the children of Israel, saith the Lord of hosts. 

###### 4 
And in that day the glory of Jacob shall be made clean. 

###### 5 
And it shall be as when the harvest man gathereth the corn, and reapeth the ears with his arm, and he shall be as he that gathereth the ears in the valley of Rephaim. 

###### 6 
Yet a gathering of grapes shall be left in it: as the shaking of an olive tree, two _or_ three berries _are_ in the top of the upmost boughs, _and_ four _or_ five in the high branches of the fruit thereof, saith the Lord God of Israel. 

###### 7 
At that day shall a man look to his maker, and his eyes shall look to the holy one of Israel. 

###### 8 
And he shall not look to the altars, the works of his own hands, neither shall he look to those things which his own fingers have made, as groves and images. 

###### 9 
In that day shall the cities of their strength be as the forsaking of boughs and branches, which they did forsake, because of the children of Israel, and there shall be desolation. 

###### 10 
Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast not remembered the God of thy strength, therefore shalt thou set pleasant plants, and shalt graft strange vine branches. 

###### 11 
In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: _but_ the harvest shall be gone in the day of possession, and _there shall be_ desperate sorrow. 

###### 12 
Ah, the multitude of many people, they shall make a sound like the noise of the sea: for the noise of the people shall make a sound like the noise of mighty waters. 

###### 13 
The people shall make a sound like the noise of many waters: _but God_ shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and as a rolling thing before the whirlwind. 

###### 14 
And lo, in the evening there _is_ trouble: _but_ afore the morning it is gone. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot of them that rob us.
