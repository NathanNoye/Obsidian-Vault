###### 1 
And in that day shall seven women take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and we will wear our own garments: only let us be called by thy name, _and_ take away our reproach. 

###### 2 
In that day shall the bud of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and pleasant for them that are escaped of Israel. 

###### 3 
Then he that shall be left in Zion, and he that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, _and_ every one shall be written among the living in Jerusalem, 

###### 4 
When the Lord shall wash the filthiness of the daughters of Zion, and purge the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. 

###### 5 
And the Lord shall create upon every place of mount Zion, and upon the assemblies thereof, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory _shall be_ a defense. 

###### 6 
And a covering shall be for a shadow in the day for the heat, and a place of refuge and a covert for the storm and for the rain.
