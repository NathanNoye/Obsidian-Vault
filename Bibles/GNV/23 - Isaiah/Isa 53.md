###### 1 
Who will believe our report? and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? 

###### 2 
But he shall grow up before him as a branch, and as a root out of a dry ground; he hath neither form nor beauty: when we shall see him, there shall be no form that we should desire him. 

###### 3 
He is despised and rejected of men: he is a man full of sorrows, and hath experience of infirmities: we hid as it were our faces from him: he was despised, and we esteemed him not. 

###### 4 
Surely, he hath born our infirmities, and carried our sorrows, yet we did judge him as plagued and smitten of God, and humbled. 

###### 5 
But he was wounded for our transgressions: he was broken for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace _was_ upon him, and with his stripes are we healed. 

###### 6 
All we like sheep have gone astray: we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid upon him the iniquity of us all. 

###### 7 
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet did he not open his mouth: he is brought as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth. 

###### 8 
He was taken out from prison, and from judgment: and who shall declare his age? for he was cut out of the land of the living: for the transgression of my people was he plagued. 

###### 9 
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no wickedness, neither _was_ any deceit in his mouth. 

###### 10 
Yet the Lord would break him and make him subject to infirmities: when he shall make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see _his_ seed _and_ shall prolong _his_ days, and the will of the Lord shall prosper in his hand. 

###### 11 
He shall see of the travail of his soul, _and_ shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many: for he shall bear their iniquities. 

###### 12 
Therefore will I give him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he hath poured out his soul unto death; and he was counted with the transgressors, and he bare the sin of many, and prayed for the trespassers.
