###### 1 
Cry aloud, spare not: lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and show my people their transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins. 

###### 2 
Yet they seek me daily, and will know my ways, even as a nation that did righteously, and had not forsaken the statutes of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice: they will draw near unto God, _saying_, 

###### 3 
Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest it not? we have punished ourselves, and thou regardest it not. Behold, in the day of your fast you will seek _your_ will, and require all your debts. 

###### 4 
Behold, ye fast to strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as _ye do_ today, to make your voice to be heard above. 

###### 5 
Is it such a fast that I have chosen, that a man should afflict his soul for a day, and to bow down his head, as a bull rush, and to lie down in sackcloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a fasting, or an acceptable day to the Lord? 

###### 6 
Is not this the fasting that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to take off the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke? 

###### 7 
Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that wander, unto thine house? when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and hide not thyself from thine own flesh? 

###### 8 
Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine health shall grow speedily: thy righteousness shall go before thee, _and_ the glory of the Lord shall embrace thee. 

###### 9 
Then shalt thou call, and the Lord shall answer: thou shalt cry, and he shall say, Here I am: if thou take away from the midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and wicked speaking: 

###### 10 
If thou pour out thy soul to the hungry, and refresh the troubled soul: then shall thy light spring out in the darkness, and thy darkness _shall be_ as the noon day. 

###### 11 
And the Lord shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy soul in drought, and make fat thy bones, and thou shalt be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters fail not. 

###### 12 
And they shall be of thee, that shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations for many generations, and thou shalt be called the repairer of the breach, _and_ the restorer of the paths to dwell in. 

###### 13 
If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy will on mine Holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight to consecrate it, _as_ glorious to the Lord, and shalt honor him, not doing thine own ways, nor seeking thine own will, nor speaking a vain word, 

###### 14 
Then shalt thou delight in the Lord, and I will cause thee to mount upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it.
