###### 1 
Ho, everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and ye that have no silver, come, buy and eat: come, I say, buy wine and milk without silver and without money. 

###### 2 
Wherefore do ye lay out silver, _and_ not for bread? and your labor without being satisfied? hearken diligently unto me, and eat that which is good, and let your soul delight in fatness. 

###### 3 
Incline your ears, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, _even_ the sure mercies of David. 

###### 4 
Behold, I gave him for a witness to the people, for a prince and a master unto the people. 

###### 5 
Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and a nation that knew not thee, shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God, and the Holy one of Israel: for he hath glorified thee. 

###### 6 
Seek ye the Lord while he may be found: call ye upon him while he is near. 

###### 7 
Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous his own imaginations, and return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he is very ready to forgive. 

###### 8 
For my thoughts _are_ not your thoughts, neither _are_ your ways my ways, saith the Lord. 

###### 9 
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts. 

###### 10 
Surely as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returneth not thither but watereth the earth, and maketh it to bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and bread unto him that eateth, 

###### 11 
So shall my word be, that goeth out of my mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I will, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. 

###### 12 
Therefore ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace; the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into joy, and all the trees of the field shall clap _their_ hands. 

###### 13 
For thorns there shall grow fir trees; for nettles shall grow the myrrh tree, and it shall be to the Lord for a name, _and_ for an everlasting sign that shall not be taken away.
