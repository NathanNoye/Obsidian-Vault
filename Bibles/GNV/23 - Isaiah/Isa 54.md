###### 1 
Rejoice, O barren that didst not bear: break forth into joy and rejoice, thou that didst not travail with child; for the desolate hath more children than the married wife, saith the Lord. 

###### 2 
Enlarge the place of thy tents, and let them spread out the curtains of thine habitations: spare not: stretch out thy cords, and make fast thy stakes. 

###### 3 
For thou shalt increase on the right hand and on the left, and thy seed shall possess the Gentiles, and dwell in the desolate cities. 

###### 4 
Fear not: for thou shalt not be ashamed, neither shalt thou be confounded: for thou shalt not be put to shame: yea, thou shalt forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood anymore. 

###### 5 
For he that made thee, _is_ thine husband, (whose name _is_ the Lord of hosts) and thy redeemer the holy One of Israel, shall be called the God of the whole world. 

###### 6 
For the Lord hath called thee, being as a woman forsaken, and afflicted in spirit, and _as_ a young wife when thou wast refused, saith thy God. 

###### 7 
For a little while have I forsaken thee, but with great compassion will I gather thee. 

###### 8 
For a moment in _mine_ anger, I hid my face from thee for a little season, but with everlasting mercy have I had compassion on thee, saith the Lord thy redeemer. 

###### 9 
For this is unto me _as_ the waters of Noah; for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth, so have I sworn that I would not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee. 

###### 10 
For the mountains shall remove, and the hills shall fall down; but my mercy shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace fall away, saith the Lord, that hath compassion on thee. 

###### 11 
O thou afflicted and tossed with tempest, that hast no comfort, behold, I will lay thy stones with the carbuncle, and lay thy foundation with sapphires, 

###### 12 
And I will make thy windows of emeralds, and thy gates shining stones, and all thy borders of pleasant stones. 

###### 13 
And all thy children _shall be_ taught of the Lord, and much peace shall be to thy children. 

###### 14 
In righteousness shalt thou be established, _and_ be far from oppression; for thou shalt not fear it: and from fear; for it shall not come near thee. 

###### 15 
Behold, _the enemies_ shall gather himself, but without me: whosoever shall gather himself in thee, against thee, shall fall. 

###### 16 
Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, and him that bringeth forth an instrument for his work, and I have created the destroyer to destroy. 

###### 17 
But all the weapons that are made against thee, shall not prosper: and every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment, thou shalt condemn. This is the heritage of the Lord's servants, and their righteousness _is_ of me, saith the Lord.
