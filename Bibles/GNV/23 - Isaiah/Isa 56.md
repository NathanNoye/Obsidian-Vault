###### 1 
Thus saith the Lord, Keep judgment and do justice, for my salvation is at hand to come, and my righteousness to be revealed. 

###### 2 
Blessed _is_ the man that doeth this, and the son of man which layeth hold on it; he that keepeth the Sabbath, and polluteth it not, and keepeth his hand from doing any evil. 

###### 3 
And let not the son of the strangers, which is joined to the Lord, speak and say, The Lord hath surely separated me from his people; neither let the Eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree. 

###### 4 
For thus saith the Lord unto the Eunuchs that keep my Sabbaths, and choose the thing that pleaseth me, and take hold of my covenant, 

###### 5 
Even unto them will I give in mine House and within my walls, a place, and a name better than of the sons and of the daughters; I will give them an everlasting name, that shall not be put out. 

###### 6 
Also the strangers that cleave unto the Lord, to serve him, and to love the Name of the Lord, and to be his servants; everyone that keepeth the Sabbath, and polluteth it not, and embraceth my covenant, 

###### 7 
Them will I bring also to mine holy mountain, and make them joyful in mine House of prayer; their burnt offerings and their sacrifices _shall be_ accepted upon mine altar: for mine house shall be called an house of prayer for all people. 

###### 8 
The Lord God saith, which gathereth the scattered of Israel, Yet will I gather to them those that are to be gathered to them. 

###### 9 
All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, _even_ all ye beasts of the forest. 

###### 10 
Their watchmen are all blind: they have no knowledge: they are all dumb dogs: they cannot bark: they lie and sleep, and delight in sleeping. 

###### 11 
And these greedy dogs can never have enough: and these shepherds cannot understand: _for_ they all look to their own way, everyone for his advantage, _and_ for his own purpose. 

###### 12 
Come, I will bring wine, and we will fill ourselves with strong drink, and tomorrow shall be as this day, _and_ much more abundant.
