###### 1 
Arise, _O Jerusalem_; be bright, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. 

###### 2 
For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness the people; but the Lord shall arise upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. 

###### 3 
And the Gentiles shall walk in thy light, and Kings at the brightness of thy rising up. 

###### 4 
Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these are gathered, _and_ come to thee: thy sons shall come from far, and thy daughters shall be nourished at _thy_ side. 

###### 5 
Then thou shalt see and shine: thine heart shall be astonied and enlarged, because the multitude of the sea shall be converted unto thee, and the riches of the Gentiles shall come unto thee. 

###### 6 
The multitude of camels shall cover thee: and the dromedaries of Midian and of Ephah: all they of Sheba shall come: they shall bring gold and incense, and show forth the praises of the Lord. 

###### 7 
All the sheep of Kedar shall be gathered unto thee: the rams of Nebajoth shall serve thee: they shall come up to be accepted upon mine altar: and I will beautify the house of my glory. 

###### 8 
Who are these that fly like a cloud, and as the doves to their windows? 

###### 9 
Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish, as at the beginning, that they may bring thy sons from far, _and_ their silver and their gold with them unto the Name of the Lord thy God, and to the Holy one of Israel, because he hath glorified thee. 

###### 10 
And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their Kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee, but in my mercy I had compassion on thee. 

###### 11 
Therefore thy gates shall be open continually: neither day nor night shall they be shut, that men may bring unto thee the riches of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought. 

###### 12 
For the nation and the kingdom, that will not serve thee, shall perish: and those nations shall be utterly destroyed. 

###### 13 
The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the elm and the box tree together to beautify the place of my Sanctuary: for I will glorify the place of my feet. 

###### 14 
The sons also of them that afflicted thee, shall come and bow unto thee: and all they that despised thee, shall fall down at the soles of thy feet: and they shall call thee; The city of the Lord, Zion of the Holy one of Israel. 

###### 15 
Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went _by thee_, I will make thee an eternal glory, and a joy from generation to generation. 

###### 16 
Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck the breasts of Kings: and thou shalt know, that I the Lord am thy Savior, and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of Jacob. 

###### 17 
For brass will I bring gold, and for iron will I bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron. I will also make thy government peace, and thine exactors righteousness. 

###### 18 
Violence shall no more be heard of in thy land, neither desolation, nor destruction within thy borders: but thou shalt call salvation, thy walls, and praise, thy gates. 

###### 19 
Thou shalt have no more Sun to shine by day, neither shall the brightness of the Moon shine unto thee: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God, thy glory. 

###### 20 
Thy Sun shall never go down, neither shall thy Moon be hid: for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy sorrow shall be ended. 

###### 21 
Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall possess the land forever, the grass of my planting shall be the work of mine hands, that I may be glorified. 

###### 22 
A little one shall become as a thousand, and a small one as a strong nation: I the Lord will hasten it in due time.
