###### 1 
O Lord, thou art my God: I will exalt thee, I will praise thy Name: for thou hast done wonderful things, _according to_ the counsels of old, with a stable truth. 

###### 2 
For thou hast made of a city an heap, of a strong city, a ruin: _even_ the place of strangers of a city, it shall never be built. 

###### 3 
Therefore shall the mighty people give glory unto thee: the city of the strong nations shall fear thee. 

###### 4 
For thou hast been a strength unto the poor, _even_ a strength to the needy in his trouble, a refuge against the tempest, a shadow against the heat: for the blast of the mighty is like a storm _against_ the wall. 

###### 5 
Thou shalt bring down the noise of the strangers, as the heat in a dry place; he will bring down the song of the mighty, _as_ the heat in the shadow of a cloud. 

###### 6 
And in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, _even_ a feast of fined _wines, and_ of fat things full of marrow, of _wines_ fined _and_ purified. 

###### 7 
And he will destroy in this mountain the covering that covereth all people, and the veil that is spread upon all nations. 

###### 8 
He will destroy death forever: and the Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the rebuke of his people will he take away out of all the earth: for the Lord hath spoken it. 

###### 9 
And in that day shall men say, Lo, this is our God: we have waited for him, and he will save us. This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will rejoice and be joyful in salvation. 

###### 10 
For in this mountain shall the hand of the Lord rest, and Moab shall be threshed under him even as straw is threshed in Madmenah. 

###### 11 
And he shall stretch out his hand in the midst of them (as he that swimmeth stretcheth _them_ out to swim) and with the strength of his hands shall he bring down their pride. 

###### 12 
The defense also of the height of thy walls shall he bring down and lay low, _and_ cast them to the ground, _even_ unto the dust.
