###### 1 
Woe unto them that go down into Egypt for help, and stay upon horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many, and in horsemen, because they be very strong; but they look not unto the Holy one of Israel, nor seek unto the Lord. 

###### 2 
But he yet is wisest; therefore he will bring evil, and not turn back his word, but he will arise against the house of the wicked, and against the help of them that work vanity. 

###### 3 
Now the Egyptians _are_ men and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit; and when the Lord shall stretch out his hand, the helper shall fall, and he that is helped shall fall, and they shall altogether fail. 

###### 4 
For this hath the Lord spoken unto me, As the lion or lion's whelp roareth upon his prey, against whom _if_ a multitude of shepherds be called, he will not be afraid at their voice, neither will humble himself at their noise: so shall the Lord of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and for the hill thereof. 

###### 5 
As birds that fly, so shall the Lord of hosts defend Jerusalem by defending and delivering, by passing through and preserving it. 

###### 6 
O ye children of Israel, turn again, in as much as ye are sunken deep in rebellion. 

###### 7 
For in that day every man shall cast out his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which your hands have made you, _even_ a sin. 

###### 8 
Then shall Assyria fall by the sword, not of man, neither shall the sword of man devour him, and he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall faint. 

###### 9 
And he shall go for fear to his tower, and his princes shall be afraid of the standard, saith the Lord, whose fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.
