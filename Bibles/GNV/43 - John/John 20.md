###### 1 
Now the first _day_ of the week came Mary Magdalene, early when it was yet dark, unto the sepulcher, and saw the stone taken away from the tomb. 

###### 2 
Then she ran, and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the sepulcher, and we know not where they have laid him. 

###### 3 
Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they came unto the sepulcher. 

###### 4 
So they ran both together, but the other disciple did outrun Peter, and came first to the sepulcher. 

###### 5 
And he stooped down, and saw the linen clothes lying: yet went he not in. 

###### 6 
Then came Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and saw the linen clothes lie, 

###### 7 
And the kerchief that was upon his head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. 

###### 8 
Then went in also the other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw it, and believed. 

###### 9 
For as yet they knew not the Scripture, That he must rise again from the dead. 

###### 10 
And the disciples went away again unto their own home. 

###### 11 
¶ But Mary stood without at the sepulcher weeping: and as she wept, she bowed herself into the sepulcher, 

###### 12 
And saw two Angels in white, sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain. 

###### 13 
And they said unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She said unto them, They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him. 

###### 14 
When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus. 

###### 15 
Jesus saith unto her, **Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? **She supposing that he had been the gardener, said unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away. 

###### 16 
Jesus saith unto her, **Mary. **She turned herself, and said unto him, Rabboni, which is to say, Master. 

###### 17 
Jesus saith unto her, **Touch me not: for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and to your Father, and to my God, and your God.

###### 18 
Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her. 

###### 19 
¶ The same day then at night, which was the first _day_ of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and said to them, **Peace **_**be**_** unto you.

###### 20 
And when he had so said, he showed unto them _his_ hands, and his side. Then were the disciples glad when they had seen the Lord. 

###### 21 
Then said Jesus to them again, **Peace **_**be**_** unto you: as my Father sent me, so send I you.

And when he had said that, he breathed on them, and said unto them, **Receive the holy Ghost.

###### 24 
¶ But Thomas one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came. 

###### 25 
The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord: but he said unto them, Except I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put mine hand into his side, I will not believe it. 

###### 26 
¶ And eight days after, again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. _Then_ came Jesus, when the doors were shut, and stood in the midst, and said, **Peace **_**be**_** unto you.

###### 27 
After said he to Thomas, **Put thy finger here, and see mine hands, and put forth thine hand, and put it into my side, and be not faithless, but faithful.

###### 28 
Then Thomas answered, and said unto him, _Thou art_ my Lord, and my God. 

###### 29 
Jesus said unto him, **Thomas, because thou hast seen me, thou believest: blessed **_**are**_** they that have not seen, and have believed.

###### 30 
And many other signs also did Jesus in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. 

###### 31 
But these things are written that ye might believe, that Jesus is that Christ that Son of God, and that in believing ye might have life through his Name.
