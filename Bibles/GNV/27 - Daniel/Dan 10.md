###### 1 
In the third year of Cyrus King of Persia, a thing was revealed unto Daniel (whose name was called Belteshazzar) and the word _was_ true, but the time appointed _was_ long, and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision. 

###### 2 
At the same time I Daniel was in heaviness for three weeks of days. 

###### 3 
I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three weeks of days were fulfilled. 

###### 4 
And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of that great river, even Hiddekel, 

###### 5 
And I lifted mine eyes, and looked, and behold, there _was_ a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz. 

###### 6 
His body also _was_ like the Chrysolite, and his face (to look upon) like the lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet _were_ like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words _was_ like the voice of a multitude. 

###### 7 
And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me, saw not the vision: but a great fear fell upon them, so that they fled away and hid themselves. 

###### 8 
Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my strength was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no power. 

###### 9 
Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, I slept on my face, and my face _was_ toward the ground. 

###### 10 
And behold, an hand touched me, which set me up upon my knees, and upon the palms of mine hands, 

###### 11 
And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand in thy place: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had said this word unto me, I stood trembling. 

###### 12 
Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come for thy words. 

###### 13 
But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but lo, Michael one of the chief princes, came to help me, and I remained there by the Kings of Persia. 

###### 14 
Now I am come to show thee what shall come to thy people in the latter days: for yet the vision _is_ for _many_ days. 

###### 15 
And when he spake these words unto me, I set my face toward the ground, and held my tongue. 

###### 16 
And behold, one like the similitude of the sons of man touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said unto him that stood before me, O my Lord, by the vision my sorrows are returned upon me, and I have retained no strength. 

###### 17 
For how can the servant of this my Lord talk with my Lord _being_ such one? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me. 

###### 18 
Then there came again, and touched me, one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me, 

###### 19 
And said, O man, greatly beloved, fear not: peace _be_ unto thee: be strong and of good courage. And when he had spoken unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my Lord speak: for thou hast strengthened me. 

###### 20 
Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? but now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, lo, the Prince of Greece shall come. 

###### 21 
But I will show thee that which is decreed in the Scripture of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael your prince.
