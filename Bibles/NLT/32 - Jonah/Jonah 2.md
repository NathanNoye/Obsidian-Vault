###### 1 
Then Jonah prayed to the LORD his God from inside the fish. 

###### 2 
He said, "I cried out to the LORD in my great trouble, and he answered me. I called to you from the land of the dead, and LORD, you heard me! 

###### 3 
You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. The mighty waters engulfed me; I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves. 

###### 4 
Then I said, 'O LORD, you have driven me from your presence. Yet I will look once more toward your holy Temple.' 

###### 5 
"I sank beneath the waves, and the waters closed over me. Seaweed wrapped itself around my head. 

###### 6 
I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the earth, whose gates lock shut forever. But you, O LORD my God, snatched me from the jaws of death! 

###### 7 
As my life was slipping away, I remembered the LORD. And my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy Temple. 

###### 8 
Those who worship false gods turn their backs on all God's mercies. 

###### 9 
But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows. For my salvation comes from the LORD alone." 

###### 10 
Then the LORD ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach.
