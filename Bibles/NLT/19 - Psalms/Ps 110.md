###### 1 
The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet." 

###### 2 
The LORD will extend your powerful kingdom from Jerusalem; you will rule over your enemies. 

###### 3 
When you go to war, your people will serve you willingly. You are arrayed in holy garments, and your strength will be renewed each day like the morning dew. 

###### 4 
The LORD has taken an oath and will not break his vow: "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek." 

###### 5 
The Lord stands at your right hand to protect you. He will strike down many kings when his anger erupts. 

###### 6 
He will punish the nations and fill their lands with corpses; he will shatter heads over the whole earth. 

###### 7 
But he himself will be refreshed from brooks along the way. He will be victorious.
