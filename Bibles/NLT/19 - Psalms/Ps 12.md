###### 1 
Help, O LORD, for the godly are fast disappearing! The faithful have vanished from the earth! 

###### 2 
Neighbors lie to each other, speaking with flattering lips and deceitful hearts. 

###### 3 
May the LORD cut off their flattering lips and silence their boastful tongues. 

###### 4 
They say, "We will lie to our hearts' content. Our lips are our own--who can stop us?" 

###### 5 
The LORD replies, "I have seen violence done to the helpless, and I have heard the groans of the poor. Now I will rise up to rescue them, as they have longed for me to do." 

###### 6 
The LORD's promises are pure, like silver refined in a furnace, purified seven times over. 

###### 7 
Therefore, LORD, we know you will protect the oppressed, preserving them forever from this lying generation, 

###### 8 
even though the wicked strut about, and evil is praised throughout the land.
