***


###### 1 
Those who trust in the LORD are as secure as Mount Zion; they will not be defeated but will endure forever. 

###### 2 
Just as the mountains surround Jerusalem, so the LORD surrounds his people, both now and forever. 

###### 3 
The wicked will not rule the land of the godly, for then the godly might be tempted to do wrong. 

###### 4 
O LORD, do good to those who are good, whose hearts are in tune with you. 

###### 5 
But banish those who turn to crooked ways, O LORD. Take them away with those who do evil. May Israel have peace!
