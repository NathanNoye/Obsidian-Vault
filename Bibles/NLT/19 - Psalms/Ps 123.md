***


###### 1 
I lift my eyes to you, O God, enthroned in heaven. 

###### 2 
We keep looking to the LORD our God for his mercy, just as servants keep their eyes on their master, as a slave girl watches her mistress for the slightest signal. 

###### 3 
Have mercy on us, LORD, have mercy, for we have had our fill of contempt. 

###### 4 
We have had more than our fill of the scoffing of the proud and the contempt of the arrogant.
