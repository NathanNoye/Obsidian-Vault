***


###### 1 
Answer me when I call to you, O God who declares me innocent. Free me from my troubles. Have mercy on me and hear my prayer. 

###### 2 
How long will you people ruin my reputation? How long will you make groundless accusations? How long will you continue your lies? Interlude 

###### 3 
You can be sure of this: The LORD set apart the godly for himself. The LORD will answer when I call to him. 

###### 4 
Don't sin by letting anger control you. Think about it overnight and remain silent. Interlude 

###### 5 
Offer sacrifices in the right spirit, and trust the LORD. 

###### 6 
Many people say, "Who will show us better times?" Let your face smile on us, LORD. 

###### 7 
You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine. 

###### 8 
In peace I will lie down and sleep, for you alone, O LORD, will keep me safe.
