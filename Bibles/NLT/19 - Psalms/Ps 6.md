***


###### 1 
O LORD, don't rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your rage. 

###### 2 
Have compassion on me, LORD, for I am weak. Heal me, LORD, for my bones are in agony. 

###### 3 
I am sick at heart. How long, O LORD, until you restore me? 

###### 4 
Return, O LORD, and rescue me. Save me because of your unfailing love. 

###### 5 
For the dead do not remember you. Who can praise you from the grave? 

###### 6 
I am worn out from sobbing. All night I flood my bed with weeping, drenching it with my tears. 

###### 7 
My vision is blurred by grief; my eyes are worn out because of all my enemies. 

###### 8 
Go away, all you who do evil, for the LORD has heard my weeping. 

###### 9 
The LORD has heard my plea; the LORD will answer my prayer. 

###### 10 
May all my enemies be disgraced and terrified. May they suddenly turn back in shame.
