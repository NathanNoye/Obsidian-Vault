###### 1 
The LORD is my shepherd; I have all that I need. 

###### 2 
He lets me rest in green meadows; he leads me beside peaceful streams. 

###### 3 
He renews my strength. He guides me along right paths, bringing honor to his name. 

###### 4 
Even when I walk through the darkest valley, I will not be afraid, for you are close beside me. Your rod and your staff protect and comfort me. 

###### 5 
You prepare a feast for me in the presence of my enemies. You honor me by anointing my head with oil. My cup overflows with blessings. 

###### 6 
Surely your goodness and unfailing love will pursue me all the days of my life, and I will live in the house of the LORD forever.
