***


###### 1 
From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me. Let all Israel repeat this: 

###### 2 
From my earliest youth my enemies have persecuted me, but they have never defeated me. 

###### 3 
My back is covered with cuts, as if a farmer had plowed long furrows. 

###### 4 
But the LORD is good; he has cut me free from the ropes of the ungodly. 

###### 5 
May all who hate Jerusalem be turned back in shameful defeat. 

###### 6 
May they be as useless as grass on a rooftop, turning yellow when only half grown, 

###### 7 
ignored by the harvester, despised by the binder. 

###### 8 
And may those who pass by refuse to give them this blessing: "The LORD bless you; we bless you in the LORD's name."
