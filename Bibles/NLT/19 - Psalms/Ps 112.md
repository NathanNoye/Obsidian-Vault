###### 1 
Praise the LORD! How joyful are those who fear the LORD and delight in obeying his commands. 

###### 2 
Their children will be successful everywhere; an entire generation of godly people will be blessed. 

###### 3 
They themselves will be wealthy, and their good deeds will last forever. 

###### 4 
Light shines in the darkness for the godly. They are generous, compassionate, and righteous. 

###### 5 
Good comes to those who lend money generously and conduct their business fairly. 

###### 6 
Such people will not be overcome by evil. Those who are righteous will be long remembered. 

###### 7 
They do not fear bad news; they confidently trust the LORD to care for them. 

###### 8 
They are confident and fearless and can face their foes triumphantly. 

###### 9 
They share freely and give generously to those in need. Their good deeds will be remembered forever. They will have influence and honor. 

###### 10 
The wicked will see this and be infuriated. They will grind their teeth in anger; they will slink away, their hopes thwarted.
