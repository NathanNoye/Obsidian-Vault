###### 1 
Why are the nations so angry? Why do they waste their time with futile plans? 

###### 2 
The kings of the earth prepare for battle; the rulers plot together against the LORD and against his anointed one. 

###### 3 
"Let us break their chains," they cry, "and free ourselves from slavery to God." 

###### 4 
But the one who rules in heaven laughs. The Lord scoffs at them. 

###### 5 
Then in anger he rebukes them, terrifying them with his fierce fury. 

###### 6 
For the Lord declares, "I have placed my chosen king on the throne in Jerusalem, on my holy mountain." 

###### 7 
The king proclaims the LORD's decree: "The LORD said to me, 'You are my son. Today I have become your Father. 

###### 8 
Only ask, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, the whole earth as your possession. 

###### 9 
You will break them with an iron rod and smash them like clay pots.'" 

###### 10 
Now then, you kings, act wisely! Be warned, you rulers of the earth! 

###### 11 
Serve the LORD with reverent fear, and rejoice with trembling. 

###### 12 
Submit to God's royal son, or he will become angry, and you will be destroyed in the midst of all your activities-- for his anger flares up in an instant. But what joy for all who take refuge in him!
