###### 1 
I pray to you, O LORD, my rock. Do not turn a deaf ear to me. For if you are silent, I might as well give up and die. 

###### 2 
Listen to my prayer for mercy as I cry out to you for help, as I lift my hands toward your holy sanctuary. 

###### 3 
Do not drag me away with the wicked-- with those who do evil-- those who speak friendly words to their neighbors while planning evil in their hearts. 

###### 4 
Give them the punishment they so richly deserve! Measure it out in proportion to their wickedness. Pay them back for all their evil deeds! Give them a taste of what they have done to others. 

###### 5 
They care nothing for what the LORD has done or for what his hands have made. So he will tear them down, and they will never be rebuilt! 

###### 6 
Praise the LORD! For he has heard my cry for mercy. 

###### 7 
The LORD is my strength and shield. I trust him with all my heart. He helps me, and my heart is filled with joy. I burst out in songs of thanksgiving. 

###### 8 
The LORD gives his people strength. He is a safe fortress for his anointed king. 

###### 9 
Save your people! Bless Israel, your special possession. Lead them like a shepherd, and carry them in your arms forever.
