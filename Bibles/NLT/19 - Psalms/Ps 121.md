###### 1 
I look up to the mountains-- does my help come from there? 

###### 2 
My help comes from the LORD, who made heaven and earth! 

###### 3 
He will not let you stumble; the one who watches over you will not slumber. 

###### 4 
Indeed, he who watches over Israel never slumbers or sleeps. 

###### 5 
The LORD himself watches over you! The LORD stands beside you as your protective shade. 

###### 6 
The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon at night. 

###### 7 
The LORD keeps you from all harm and watches over your life. 

###### 8 
The LORD keeps watch over you as you come and go, both now and forever.
