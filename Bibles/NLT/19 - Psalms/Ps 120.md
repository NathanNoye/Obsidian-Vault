***


###### 1 
I took my troubles to the LORD; I cried out to him, and he answered my prayer. 

###### 2 
Rescue me, O LORD, from liars and from all deceitful people. 

###### 3 
O deceptive tongue, what will God do to you? How will he increase your punishment? 

###### 4 
You will be pierced with sharp arrows and burned with glowing coals. 

###### 5 
How I suffer in far-off Meshech. It pains me to live in distant Kedar. 

###### 6 
I am tired of living among people who hate peace. 

###### 7 
I search for peace; but when I speak of peace, they want war!
