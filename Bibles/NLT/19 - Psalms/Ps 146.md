***


###### 1 
Praise the LORD! Let all that I am praise the LORD. 

###### 2 
I will praise the LORD as long as I live. I will sing praises to my God with my dying breath. 

###### 3 
Don't put your confidence in powerful people; there is no help for you there. 

###### 4 
When they breathe their last, they return to the earth, and all their plans die with them. 

###### 5 
But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper, whose hope is in the LORD their God. 

###### 6 
He made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. He keeps every promise forever. 

###### 7 
He gives justice to the oppressed and food to the hungry. The LORD frees the prisoners. 

###### 8 
The LORD opens the eyes of the blind. The LORD lifts up those who are weighed down. The LORD loves the godly. 

###### 9 
The LORD protects the foreigners among us. He cares for the orphans and widows, but he frustrates the plans of the wicked. 

###### 10 
The LORD will reign forever. He will be your God, O Jerusalem, throughout the generations. Praise the LORD!
