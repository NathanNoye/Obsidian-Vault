###### 1 
Praise the LORD! Praise God in his sanctuary; praise him in his mighty heaven! 

###### 2 
Praise him for his mighty works; praise his unequaled greatness! 

###### 3 
Praise him with a blast of the ram's horn; praise him with the lyre and harp! 

###### 4 
Praise him with the tambourine and dancing; praise him with strings and flutes! 

###### 5 
Praise him with a clash of cymbals; praise him with loud clanging cymbals. 

###### 6 
Let everything that breathes sing praises to the LORD! Praise the LORD!
