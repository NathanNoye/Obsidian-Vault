###### 1 
I will exalt you, LORD, for you rescued me. You refused to let my enemies triumph over me. 

###### 2 
O LORD my God, I cried to you for help, and you restored my health. 

###### 3 
You brought me up from the grave, O LORD. You kept me from falling into the pit of death. 

###### 4 
Sing to the LORD, all you godly ones! Praise his holy name. 

###### 5 
For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime! Weeping may last through the night, but joy comes with the morning. 

###### 6 
When I was prosperous, I said, "Nothing can stop me now!" 

###### 7 
Your favor, O LORD, made me as secure as a mountain. Then you turned away from me, and I was shattered. 

###### 8 
I cried out to you, O LORD. I begged the Lord for mercy, saying, 

###### 9 
"What will you gain if I die, if I sink into the grave? Can my dust praise you? Can it tell of your faithfulness? 

###### 10 
Hear me, LORD, and have mercy on me. Help me, O LORD." 

###### 11 
You have turned my mourning into joyful dancing. You have taken away my clothes of mourning and clothed me with joy, 

###### 12 
that I might sing praises to you and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give you thanks forever!
