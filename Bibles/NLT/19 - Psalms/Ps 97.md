###### 1 
The LORD is king! Let the earth rejoice! Let the farthest coastlands be glad. 

###### 2 
Dark clouds surround him. Righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. 

###### 3 
Fire spreads ahead of him and burns up all his foes. 

###### 4 
His lightning flashes out across the world. The earth sees and trembles. 

###### 5 
The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth. 

###### 6 
The heavens proclaim his righteousness; every nation sees his glory. 

###### 7 
Those who worship idols are disgraced-- all who brag about their worthless gods-- for every god must bow to him. 

###### 8 
Jerusalem has heard and rejoiced, and all the towns of Judah are glad because of your justice, O LORD! 

###### 9 
For you, O LORD, are supreme over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods. 

###### 10 
You who love the LORD, hate evil! He protects the lives of his godly people and rescues them from the power of the wicked. 

###### 11 
Light shines on the godly, and joy on those whose hearts are right. 

###### 12 
May all who are godly rejoice in the LORD and praise his holy name!
