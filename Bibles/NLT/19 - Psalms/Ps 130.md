###### 1 
From the depths of despair, O LORD, I call for your help. 

###### 2 
Hear my cry, O Lord. Pay attention to my prayer. 

###### 3 
LORD, if you kept a record of our sins, who, O Lord, could ever survive? 

###### 4 
But you offer forgiveness, that we might learn to fear you. 

###### 5 
I am counting on the LORD; yes, I am counting on him. I have put my hope in his word. 

###### 6 
I long for the Lord more than sentries long for the dawn, yes, more than sentries long for the dawn. 

###### 7 
O Israel, hope in the LORD; for with the LORD there is unfailing love. His redemption overflows. 

###### 8 
He himself will redeem Israel from every kind of sin.
