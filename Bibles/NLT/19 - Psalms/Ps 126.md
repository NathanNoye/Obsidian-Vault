###### 1 
When the LORD brought back his exiles to Jerusalem, it was like a dream! 

###### 2 
We were filled with laughter, and we sang for joy. And the other nations said, "What amazing things the LORD has done for them." 

###### 3 
Yes, the LORD has done amazing things for us! What joy! 

###### 4 
Restore our fortunes, LORD, as streams renew the desert. 

###### 5 
Those who plant in tears will harvest with shouts of joy. 

###### 6 
They weep as they go to plant their seed, but they sing as they return with the harvest.
