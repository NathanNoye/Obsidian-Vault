###### 1 
O LORD, how long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the other way? 

###### 2 
How long must I struggle with anguish in my soul, with sorrow in my heart every day? How long will my enemy have the upper hand? 

###### 3 
Turn and answer me, O LORD my God! Restore the sparkle to my eyes, or I will die. 

###### 4 
Don't let my enemies gloat, saying, "We have defeated him!" Don't let them rejoice at my downfall. 

###### 5 
But I trust in your unfailing love. I will rejoice because you have rescued me. 

###### 6 
I will sing to the LORD because he is good to me.
