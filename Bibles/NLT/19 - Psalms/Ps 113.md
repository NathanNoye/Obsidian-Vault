Praise the LORD! Yes, give praise, O servants of the LORD. Praise the name of the LORD!

Blessed be the name of the LORD now and forever.

Everywhere--from east to west-- praise the name of the LORD.

For the LORD is high above the nations; his glory is higher than the heavens. 

###### 5 
Who can be compared with the LORD our God, who is enthroned on high? 

###### 6 
He stoops to look down on heaven and on earth. 

###### 7 
He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump. 

###### 8 
He sets them among princes, even the princes of his own people!

He gives the childless woman a family, making her a happy mother. Praise the LORD!
