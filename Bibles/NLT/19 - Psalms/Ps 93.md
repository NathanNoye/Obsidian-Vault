###### 1 
The LORD is king! He is robed in majesty. Indeed, the LORD is robed in majesty and armed with strength. The world stands firm and cannot be shaken. 

###### 2 
Your throne, O LORD, has stood from time immemorial. You yourself are from the everlasting past. 

###### 3 
The floods have risen up, O LORD. The floods have roared like thunder; the floods have lifted their pounding waves. 

###### 4 
But mightier than the violent raging of the seas, mightier than the breakers on the shore-- the LORD above is mightier than these! 

###### 5 
Your royal laws cannot be changed. Your reign, O LORD, is holy forever and ever.
