###### 1 
Keep me safe, O God, for I have come to you for refuge. 

###### 2 
I said to the LORD, "You are my Master! Every good thing I have comes from you." 

###### 3 
The godly people in the land are my true heroes! I take pleasure in them! 

###### 4 
Troubles multiply for those who chase after other gods. I will not take part in their sacrifices of blood or even speak the names of their gods. 

###### 5 
LORD, you alone are my inheritance, my cup of blessing. You guard all that is mine. 

###### 6 
The land you have given me is a pleasant land. What a wonderful inheritance! 

###### 7 
I will bless the LORD who guides me; even at night my heart instructs me. 

###### 8 
I know the LORD is always with me. I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me. 

###### 9 
No wonder my heart is glad, and I rejoice. My body rests in safety. 

###### 10 
For you will not leave my soul among the dead or allow your holy one to rot in the grave. 

###### 11 
You will show me the way of life, granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever.
