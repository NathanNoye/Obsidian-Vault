###### 1 
Sing a new song to the LORD, for he has done wonderful deeds. His right hand has won a mighty victory; his holy arm has shown his saving power! 

###### 2 
The LORD has announced his victory and has revealed his righteousness to every nation! 

###### 3 
He has remembered his promise to love and be faithful to Israel. The ends of the earth have seen the victory of our God. 

###### 4 
Shout to the LORD, all the earth; break out in praise and sing for joy! 

###### 5 
Sing your praise to the LORD with the harp, with the harp and melodious song, 

###### 6 
with trumpets and the sound of the ram's horn. Make a joyful symphony before the LORD, the King! 

###### 7 
Let the sea and everything in it shout his praise! Let the earth and all living things join in. 

###### 8 
Let the rivers clap their hands in glee! Let the hills sing out their songs of joy 

###### 9 
before the LORD, for he is coming to judge the earth. He will judge the world with justice, and the nations with fairness.
