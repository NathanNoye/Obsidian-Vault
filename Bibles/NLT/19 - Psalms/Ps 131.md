***


###### 1 
LORD, my heart is not proud; my eyes are not haughty. I don't concern myself with matters too great or too awesome for me to grasp. 

###### 2 
Instead, I have calmed and quieted myself, like a weaned child who no longer cries for its mother's milk. Yes, like a weaned child is my soul within me. 

###### 3 
O Israel, put your hope in the LORD-- now and always.
