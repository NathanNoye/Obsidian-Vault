***


###### 1 
I will sing of your love and justice, LORD. I will praise you with songs. 

###### 2 
I will be careful to live a blameless life-- when will you come to help me? I will lead a life of integrity in my own home. 

###### 3 
I will refuse to look at anything vile and vulgar. I hate all who deal crookedly; I will have nothing to do with them. 

###### 4 
I will reject perverse ideas and stay away from every evil. 

###### 5 
I will not tolerate people who slander their neighbors. I will not endure conceit and pride. 

###### 6 
I will search for faithful people to be my companions. Only those who are above reproach will be allowed to serve me. 

###### 7 
I will not allow deceivers to serve in my house, and liars will not stay in my presence. 

###### 8 
My daily task will be to ferret out the wicked and free the city of the LORD from their grip.
