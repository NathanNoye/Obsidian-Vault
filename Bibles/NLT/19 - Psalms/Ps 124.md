###### 1 
What if the LORD had not been on our side? Let all Israel repeat: 

###### 2 
What if the LORD had not been on our side when people attacked us? 

###### 3 
They would have swallowed us alive in their burning anger. 

###### 4 
The waters would have engulfed us; a torrent would have overwhelmed us. 

###### 5 
Yes, the raging waters of their fury would have overwhelmed our very lives. 

###### 6 
Praise the LORD, who did not let their teeth tear us apart! 

###### 7 
We escaped like a bird from a hunter's trap. The trap is broken, and we are free! 

###### 8 
Our help is from the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
