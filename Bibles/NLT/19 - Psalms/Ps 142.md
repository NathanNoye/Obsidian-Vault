***


###### 1 
I cry out to the LORD; I plead for the LORD's mercy. 

###### 2 
I pour out my complaints before him and tell him all my troubles. 

###### 3 
When I am overwhelmed, you alone know the way I should turn. Wherever I go, my enemies have set traps for me. 

###### 4 
I look for someone to come and help me, but no one gives me a passing thought! No one will help me; no one cares a bit what happens to me. 

###### 5 
Then I pray to you, O LORD. I say, "You are my place of refuge. You are all I really want in life. 

###### 6 
Hear my cry, for I am very low. Rescue me from my persecutors, for they are too strong for me. 

###### 7 
Bring me out of prison so I can thank you. The godly will crowd around me, for you are good to me."
