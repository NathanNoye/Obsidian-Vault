###### 1 
Who may worship in your sanctuary, LORD? Who may enter your presence on your holy hill? 

###### 2 
Those who lead blameless lives and do what is right, speaking the truth from sincere hearts. 

###### 3 
Those who refuse to gossip or harm their neighbors or speak evil of their friends. 

###### 4 
Those who despise flagrant sinners, and honor the faithful followers of the LORD, and keep their promises even when it hurts. 

###### 5 
Those who lend money without charging interest, and who cannot be bribed to lie about the innocent. Such people will stand firm forever.
