###### 1 
I trust in the LORD for protection. So why do you say to me, "Fly like a bird to the mountains for safety! 

###### 2 
The wicked are stringing their bows and fitting their arrows on the bowstrings. They shoot from the shadows at those whose hearts are right. 

###### 3 
The foundations of law and order have collapsed. What can the righteous do?" 

###### 4 
But the LORD is in his holy Temple; the LORD still rules from heaven. He watches everyone closely, examining every person on earth. 

###### 5 
The LORD examines both the righteous and the wicked. He hates those who love violence. 

###### 6 
He will rain down blazing coals and burning sulfur on the wicked, punishing them with scorching winds. 

###### 7 
For the righteous LORD loves justice. The virtuous will see his face.
