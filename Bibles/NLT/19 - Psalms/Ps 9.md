###### 1 
I will praise you, LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all the marvelous things you have done. 

###### 2 
I will be filled with joy because of you. I will sing praises to your name, O Most High. 

###### 3 
My enemies retreated; they staggered and died when you appeared. 

###### 4 
For you have judged in my favor; from your throne you have judged with fairness. 

###### 5 
You have rebuked the nations and destroyed the wicked; you have erased their names forever. 

###### 6 
The enemy is finished, in endless ruins; the cities you uprooted are now forgotten. 

###### 7 
But the LORD reigns forever, executing judgment from his throne. 

###### 8 
He will judge the world with justice and rule the nations with fairness. 

###### 9 
The LORD is a shelter for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. 

###### 10 
Those who know your name trust in you, for you, O LORD, do not abandon those who search for you. 

###### 11 
Sing praises to the LORD who reigns in Jerusalem. Tell the world about his unforgettable deeds. 

###### 12 
For he who avenges murder cares for the helpless. He does not ignore the cries of those who suffer. 

###### 13 
LORD, have mercy on me. See how my enemies torment me. Snatch me back from the jaws of death. 

###### 14 
Save me so I can praise you publicly at Jerusalem's gates, so I can rejoice that you have rescued me. 

###### 15 
The nations have fallen into the pit they dug for others. Their own feet have been caught in the trap they set. 

###### 16 
The LORD is known for his justice. The wicked are trapped by their own deeds. Quiet Interlude 

###### 17 
The wicked will go down to the grave. This is the fate of all the nations who ignore God. 

###### 18 
But the needy will not be ignored forever; the hopes of the poor will not always be crushed. 

###### 19 
Arise, O LORD! Do not let mere mortals defy you! Judge the nations! 

###### 20 
Make them tremble in fear, O LORD. Let the nations know they are merely human. Interlude
