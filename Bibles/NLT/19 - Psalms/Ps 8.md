***


###### 1 
O LORD, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth! Your glory is higher than the heavens. 

###### 2 
You have taught children and infants to tell of your strength, silencing your enemies and all who oppose you. 

###### 3 
When I look at the night sky and see the work of your fingers-- the moon and the stars you set in place-- 

###### 4 
what are mere mortals that you should think about them, human beings that you should care for them? 

###### 5 
Yet you made them only a little lower than God and crowned them with glory and honor. 

###### 6 
You gave them charge of everything you made, putting all things under their authority-- 

###### 7 
the flocks and the herds and all the wild animals, 

###### 8 
the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea, and everything that swims the ocean currents. 

###### 9 
O LORD, our Lord, your majestic name fills the earth!
