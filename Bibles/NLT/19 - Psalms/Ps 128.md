###### 1 
How joyful are those who fear the LORD-- all who follow his ways! 

###### 2 
You will enjoy the fruit of your labor. How joyful and prosperous you will be! 

###### 3 
Your wife will be like a fruitful grapevine, flourishing within your home. Your children will be like vigorous young olive trees as they sit around your table. 

###### 4 
That is the LORD's blessing for those who fear him. 

###### 5 
May the LORD continually bless you from Zion. May you see Jerusalem prosper as long as you live. 

###### 6 
May you live to enjoy your grandchildren. May Israel have peace!
