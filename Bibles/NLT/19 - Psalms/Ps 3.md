###### 1 
O LORD, I have so many enemies; so many are against me. 

###### 2 
So many are saying, "God will never rescue him!" Interlude 

###### 3 
But you, O LORD, are a shield around me; you are my glory, the one who holds my head high. 

###### 4 
I cried out to the LORD, and he answered me from his holy mountain. Interlude 

###### 5 
I lay down and slept, yet I woke up in safety, for the LORD was watching over me. 

###### 6 
I am not afraid of ten thousand enemies who surround me on every side. 

###### 7 
Arise, O LORD! Rescue me, my God! Slap all my enemies in the face! Shatter the teeth of the wicked! 

###### 8 
Victory comes from you, O LORD. May you bless your people. Interlude
