###### 1 
The LORD of Heaven's Armies says, "The day of judgment is coming, burning like a furnace. On that day the arrogant and the wicked will be burned up like straw. They will be consumed--roots, branches, and all. 

###### 2 
"But for you who fear my name, the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in his wings. And you will go free, leaping with joy like calves let out to pasture. 

###### 3 
On the day when I act, you will tread upon the wicked as if they were dust under your feet," says the LORD of Heaven's Armies. 

###### 4 
"Remember to obey the Law of Moses, my servant--all the decrees and regulations that I gave him on Mount Sinai for all Israel. 

###### 5 
"Look, I am sending you the prophet Elijah before the great and dreadful day of the LORD arrives. 

###### 6 
His preaching will turn the hearts of fathers to their children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise I will come and strike the land with a curse."
