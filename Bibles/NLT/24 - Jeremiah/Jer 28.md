###### 1 
One day in late summer of that same year--the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah--Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, addressed me publicly in the Temple while all the priests and people listened. He said, 

###### 2 
"This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: 'I will remove the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks. 

###### 3 
Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon. 

###### 4 
And I will bring back Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the other captives that were taken to Babylon. I will surely break the yoke that the king of Babylon has put on your necks. I, the LORD, have spoken!'" 

###### 5 
Jeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests and people at the Temple. 

###### 6 
He said, "Amen! May your prophecies come true! I hope the LORD does everything you say. I hope he does bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple and all the captives. 

###### 7 
But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people. 

###### 8 
The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations, always warning of war, disaster, and disease. 

###### 9 
So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right. Only when his predictions come true can we know that he is really from the LORD." 

###### 10 
Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah's neck and broke it in pieces. 

###### 11 
And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered, "This is what the LORD says: 'Just as this yoke has been broken, within two years I will break the yoke of oppression from all the nations now subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.'" With that, Jeremiah left the Temple area. 

###### 12 
Soon after this confrontation with Hananiah, the LORD gave this message to Jeremiah: 

###### 13 
"Go and tell Hananiah, 'This is what the LORD says: You have broken a wooden yoke, but you have replaced it with a yoke of iron. 

###### 14 
The LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, says: I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations, forcing them into slavery under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control.'" 

###### 15 
Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD has not sent you, but the people believe your lies. 

###### 16 
Therefore, this is what the LORD says: 'You must die. Your life will end this very year because you have rebelled against the LORD.'" 

###### 17 
Two months later the prophet Hananiah died.
