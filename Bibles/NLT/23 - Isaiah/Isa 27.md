###### 1 
In that day the LORD will take his terrible, swift sword and punish Leviathan, the swiftly moving serpent, the coiling, writhing serpent. He will kill the dragon of the sea. 

###### 2 
"In that day, sing about the fruitful vineyard. 

###### 3 
I, the LORD, will watch over it, watering it carefully. Day and night I will watch so no one can harm it. 

###### 4 
My anger will be gone. If I find briers and thorns growing, I will attack them; I will burn them up-- 

###### 5 
unless they turn to me for help. Let them make peace with me; yes, let them make peace with me." 

###### 6 
The time is coming when Jacob's descendants will take root. Israel will bud and blossom and fill the whole earth with fruit! 

###### 7 
Has the LORD struck Israel as he struck her enemies? Has he punished her as he punished them? 

###### 8 
No, but he exiled Israel to call her to account. She was exiled from her land as though blown away in a storm from the east. 

###### 9 
The LORD did this to purge Israel's wickedness, to take away all her sin. As a result, all the pagan altars will be crushed to dust. No Asherah pole or pagan shrine will be left standing. 

###### 10 
The fortified towns will be silent and empty, the houses abandoned, the streets overgrown with weeds. Calves will graze there, chewing on twigs and branches. 

###### 11 
The people are like the dead branches of a tree, broken off and used for kindling beneath the cooking pots. Israel is a foolish and stupid nation, for its people have turned away from God. Therefore, the one who made them will show them no pity or mercy. 

###### 12 
Yet the time will come when the LORD will gather them together like handpicked grain. One by one he will gather them--from the Euphrates River in the east to the Brook of Egypt in the west. 

###### 13 
In that day the great trumpet will sound. Many who were dying in exile in Assyria and Egypt will return to Jerusalem to worship the LORD on his holy mountain.
