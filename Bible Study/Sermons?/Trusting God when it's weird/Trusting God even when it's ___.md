Another way we can title this is **Trusting God when we can't see**

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 9|John 9]] talks about the miracle of Jesus healing the blind man by rubbing mud in on eyes and telling him to go into the pool of Siloam - in that order.  We'll focus on [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 9#1|John 9:1]] to [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 9#7|John 9:7]]

It's safe to assume that if one day you became blind and a group of people walked by and started talking about you that you'd feel uncomfortable. -- Now imagine the next thing you hear is someone spit -- and then you feel mud being rubbed on your eyes. I know I would have all these thoughts going through my head wondering who is this guy who felt the need to put dirt on my eyes.

Based on the text, we don't know what the man was feeling while this was happening but we do know what his response was.

After Jesus rubbed the mud on his eyes, he told him to go into the pool of Siloam to wash the mud off. **This is critical point in the story** because this is where the man, in faith, listens to what Jesus tells him without event knowing him. 

Maybe word had spread about a man performing miracles and healings and maybe he had heard it while either on the street or during meals with his family but we know for certain he didn't know who was Jesus or what his voice sounded like at this point.

At this time, the man goes down to the pool, washes the mud from his eyes, and receives his sight. -- We also know that between verse 7 and 8 that Jesus and the disciples had left because when he returned - people asked "where is he", he said "I don't know" ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 9#12|John 9:12]]) so we know that Jesus wasn't at the pool with the man.

There's a couple things that stand out to me from this small - but powerful - interaction:
1. Jesus wasn't physically nearby when the man was healed which is a throwback to Jesus healing the official's son back in John 4.
2. This interaction has parallels with [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 20#29|John 20:29]] 
3. But more importantly: Jesus gave the man a commandment and even though it may have seemed odd or weird - the blind man followed the commandment and received his healing.

We see this over and over again in the book of John talking about faith and not needing to necessarily understand or see what Jesus is going to do but rather to trust him and have faith in his word.

This man could have turned around and gone home! He could have sat there and just rubbed the mud from his eyes that this random stranger put on his eyes but instead he decided - through faith - to follow what Jesus said. 

Here's why I say "trusting God when it's weird". He didn't understand why Jesus mixed spit and mud and put it on his eyes and he didn't understand why he needed to wash it off but regardless of his own understanding - he still did it. He stepped out in faith and listened to what Jesus did and witnessed a miracle on his own life. -- And the crazy thing too? It wasn't just him that was affected by this miracle - his neighbours were not sure if this was him because he could now see ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 9#9|John 9:9]]). These people had first hand accounts of a miracle healing because he stepped out in faith and it makes me think how many opportunities did we miss to show people the grace and miracles that Jesus does because we were too afraid to step out in faith.

Later in the chapter, we see this argument that gets heated between the man and the Pharisees about who healed him. He tells them it was Jesus.

> We don't know when he learned Jesus' name during this interaction but he knows it was Jesus that healed him.
> 
> Could this be because he knew of a healer performing miracles and his name was Jesus? Did he connect the dots? We don't know 100% but we know that he knew it was Jesus by the time he was talking to the pharisees.

The argument goes back and forth with the blind man simply stating what happened and the Pharisees continuing to press him for answers. Eventually this results in them throwing him out onto the streets.

Jesus heard that the Pharisees had thrown the man out and Jesus eventually found him and asked him "Do you believe in the Son of Man?". The man replied asking who the Son of Man was so he could believe in him and Jesus told him "You've seen him and you're talking to him now". The man replied with "I believe Lord!" 

All this happened because a blind man followed a commandment from Jesus when he didn't know what would happen.
