Short answer - it's unclear but we very strongly YES.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#5|John 3:5]] mentions water and spirit. There's debate around the "water" part. Let me explain the two schools of thoughts:
1. The first school of thought is the water is the amniotic fluid from a womb that comes from a physical birth. While this does contrast the spiritual birth, it seems like a weak argument since there's no other relation to it. This also is not a widely accepted view. The Greeks and Romans were aware of the amniotic sac at the time but was limited. 
2. The second thought is the water is baptism. There's arguments around being saved by faith and not by works in [[Bibles/CSB/49 - Ephesians/Eph 2#8|Eph 2:8]] and [[Bibles/CSB/49 - Ephesians/Eph 2#9|Eph 2:9]] however this seems to point more towards being saved through God and not ourselves - we can't save ourselves; only God can. There's also MULTIPLE verses indicating the importances of baptism. Most notably [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 16#16|Mark 16:16]] where it mention having belief AND baptism. Other verses that show the importance of baptism are the following: 
	- [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 28#19|Matt 28:19]] and [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 28#20|Matt 28:20]]. This is Jesus telling the Disciples to go out and baptize everyone and to teach them everything (which baptism is one thing he taught)
	- [[Bibles/CSB/44 - Acts/Acts 2#38|Acts 2:38]] - Peter is telling people to repent and be baptized.

One argument against baptism as a requirement is that baptism itself doesn't "earn" your salvation - faith in Jesus does but it doesn't sit right to remove the role of baptism in salvation. Knowing that Jesus calls his disciples to go out and be baptized and being baptized is a public declaration of faith and "faith without works is dead" [[Bibles/CSB/59 - James/Jas 2#14|Jas 2:14]] - does this not mean we are putting more faith in Jesus since we are having to put a physical action in motion by following his word - demonstrating our faith? We go into water all the time for swimming and showering essentially never for baptism. We go into water for baptism for a specific reason - and that reason is faith. While there's arguments that baptism isn't required for salvation - there's much more arguing that it is a step we should take regardless.

In [[Bible Study/üî• MAIN STUDY/01 - John/John 3#6|John 3:6]], it mentions that what is born of flesh is flesh and what is born of spirit is spirit. The previous verse says we must be born of spirit. This means we need a spiritual rebirthing. This idea of being reborn spiritually and the importance of baptism is shown in [[Bibles/CSB/45 - Romans/Rom 6#3|Rom 6:3]] and [[Bibles/CSB/45 - Romans/Rom 6#4|Rom 6:4]]. These verses talk about through baptism we die, are buried, and risen to new life through the glory of the Father - This means we are spiritually reborn. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#5|John 3:5]] says this is something we need to do. This is being born of water and spirit.

One thing to note is in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#9|John 3:9]] - Nicodemus seems confused and Jesus asks him **"Are you a teacher of Israel and don't know these things?"**. This could be indicating that Nicodemus was confused about being born of water since the old testament didn't have a water baptism like we do in the new testament HOWEVER [[Bibles/CSB/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek 36#25|Ezek 36:25]] talks about the prophesy cleansing them with water. This could be symbolic or it could mean literal water but the fact that this is a prophecy and that Jesus indicates that Nicodemus should have known about something like this potentially points to a physical water baptism.

### Arguments against baptism: 
- We're saved by grace and faith, not works
- "Born of water" is amniotic fluid? üòê Although straight forward, you can only be born with amniotic fluid. 

### Arguments for baptism
- [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 16#16|Mark 16:16]] 
- [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 28#19|Matt 28:19]] and [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 28#20|Matt 28:20]]
- [[Bibles/CSB/44 - Acts/Acts 2#38|Acts 2:38]]
- We need to be born of spirit (or also known as "spiritually reborn"). [[Bibles/CSB/45 - Romans/Rom 6#3|Rom 6:3]] and [[Bibles/CSB/45 - Romans/Rom 6#4|Rom 6:4]] explains how.
- [[Bibles/CSB/48 - Galatians/Gal 3#27|Gal 3:27]] uses imagery to show being "clothed with Christ" meaning you are united with Christ.
- The prophecy in [[Bibles/CSB/26 - Ezekiel/Ezek 36#25|Ezek 36:25]] is potentially pointing towards physical water and not symbolic.

### More thoughts on the amniotic fluid argument
- Apparently there are cases where amniotic fluid is low or not detectable and apparently some babies have been born without amniotic fluid but I wasn't able to find any specific cases so I don't count this as part of the any argument but good to know.
- PROM is a condition where the membrane ruptures pre-maturely - your water breaking too soon
