## Types
### Influence (or oppression)
This refers to a situation where a person is under the attack or influence of demonic forces but is not fully controlled or inhabited by a demon. The individual may experience a range of negative effects, such as temptation, depression, thoughts of despair, physical ailments, or other hardships that are believed to be exacerbated by demonic forces. The person retains control over their actions but may feel overwhelmed by external spiritual pressure.
### Possessions
This is a condition in which a demon or unclean spirit has gained significant control over an individual, to the point where the demon can control the person's actions and faculties. In cases of possession, the individual may lose their ability to control their own actions or speech and may exhibit behaviors or abilities that are not their own. The accounts in the New Testament, such as the boy in Mark 9:14-29, often show the demon speaking through the individual or exhibiting supernatural strength or other phenomena.

## Teachings about possession
### The parable about the strong man
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 3#27|Mark 3:27]] - This is reiterating the same points. Satan is the "strong man" in this story and his "house" is his domain and the goods are what he possesses. In Matthew, this is a blind and mute man whom Jesus releases from the power of a demon ([[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 12#22|Matthew 12:22]]). Jesus cannot use Satan's power to cast out the demon because He needs to bind Satan in order to free the man. He does this through the power of the Holy Spirit.
