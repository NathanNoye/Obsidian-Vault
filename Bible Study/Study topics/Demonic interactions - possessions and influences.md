## Types
### Influence (or oppression)
This refers to a situation where a person is under the attack or influence of demonic forces but is not fully controlled or inhabited by a demon. The individual may experience a range of negative effects, such as temptation, depression, thoughts of despair, physical ailments, or other hardships that are believed to be exacerbated by demonic forces. The person retains control over their actions but may feel overwhelmed by external spiritual pressure.
### Possessions
This is a condition in which a demon or unclean spirit has gained significant control over an individual, to the point where the demon can control the person's actions and faculties. In cases of possession, the individual may lose their ability to control their own actions or speech and may exhibit behaviors or abilities that are not their own. The accounts in the New Testament, such as the boy in Mark 9:14-29, often show the demon speaking through the individual or exhibiting supernatural strength or other phenomena.

## Instances in the bible
### Mark 9:14 - A boy was possessed
**Verse:** [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 9#14-29|Mark 9:14-29]] 
**Symptoms:** Mute, seizures, foaming mouth, grinding teeth, becomes [[rigid]].
**Outcome:** The boy seemed dead
**Key notes:** 
- The disciples couldn't cast it out but Jesus could. Jesus said this kind doesn't come out except through prayer (some add "and fasting"). 
- Some possessions are stronger than others so we need to be ready by spending time with God, having a relationship with him. Prayer and Fasting are good ways to build your relationship with him. Spending time in his word also.
