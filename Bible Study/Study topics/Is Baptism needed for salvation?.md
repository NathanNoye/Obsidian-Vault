*TL;DR - No, but it's a commandment from God and if we truly believe in Him, we'll want to be baptized and follow his commandments.*

### Historical information
Baptism has been used as a rite of initiation, showing the inductee’s entrance into a new belief or observance

### Fire notes
- "It is not the absence of baptism that condemns but the *despising* of baptism". And by "despising" this means basically saying no to God. If you have faith in God, you'll want to follow his commands and one of his commands is to get baptized. If you love God, how can you disobey Him.
- "Faith that does not result in actions is a dead faith". This quote is saying our faith in God should move us to action. One action is baptism - although that is not to say not getting baptised means we're not saved.


### Nate's ramblings
- If we are saved by faith and not works, that seems to point that we are do not need to be baptized. 
- Why does Jesus command us to get baptized. Is this just a command and not a requirement? It seems to pair well will "faith without works is dead" since if we have faith - we'll be moved to do works.
- Is believing a verb or action? If it's an action - does that mean we need to do something to show our faith? Bible says though that we are NOT saved by works.
- Is baptism a way to show the world who we belong to?
- Is *baptism* actually meaning being baptized by the holy spirit?

### What we know
- Jesus commanded the disciples to go out and baptize us ([[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 28#19|Matt 28:19]] and [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 28#20|Matt 28:20]])
- Peter is telling people to be baptized ([[Bibles/CSB/44 - Acts/Acts 2#38|Acts 2:38]])
- Jesus was baptized even though he was sinless. After he was baptized - God's voice was heard and said that "This is his Son who he's well pleased with". This is BEFORE Jesus did any miracles (as far as we know but it's safe to assume so).

[[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 3#11|Matt 3:11]] - John is baptizing by water but Jesus will baptize us by the Holy Spirit and with fire. This seems to indicate there are 2 types of baptisms
[[Bibles/CSB/49 - Ephesians/Eph 4#5|Eph 4:5]] - This mentions there is one baptism
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#6|John 3:6]] seems to be emphasizing the distinction between physical and spiritual in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#5|John 3:5]]. Or is this emphasizing being born again?
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 16#16|Mark 16:16]] seems to make it clear that we need baptism BUT those verses are very likely to have been added in after. Do the other gospels say the same thing?
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#8|Mark 1:8]] is talking about how John baptized with water but Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit.
