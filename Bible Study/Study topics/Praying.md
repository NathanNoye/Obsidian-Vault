Are we supposed to ask for things?
Is prayer structured?

### Quick notes
- **Pray with Confidence** - We are told to pray with confidence whenÂ we come to God in prayer, knowing He hears us and will grant whatever we ask as long as it is in His will. [[1 John 5#14|1 John 5:14]] - [[1 John 5#15|1 John 5:15]]

## Why do we Pray?
Prayer is a vital aspect of Christian life, serving as a direct communication with God. It's a practice where we can express [[Word Definitions/Adoration.md|adoration]], confession, thanksgiving, and [[Word Definitions/Supplications.md|supplications]]. Through prayer, Christians demonstrate dependence on God, seek guidance, grow spiritually, and engage in [[Word Definitions/Intercession.md|intercession]] for others. It fosters a deeper relationship with God, aligns individuals with His will, and provides peace and strength. Commanded in Scripture and exemplified by Jesus, prayer is both an act of obedience and a powerful tool in spiritual life, essential for personal and communal faith development.
