### Quick notes
- **Pray with Confidence** - We are told to pray with confidence when we come to God in prayer, knowing He hears us and will grant whatever we ask as long as it is in His will. [[1 John 5#14|1 John 5:14]] - [[1 John 5#15|1 John 5:15]]
- [[Jesus]] prays a beautiful prayer in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 17|John 17]]

## Why do we Pray?
Prayer is a Christian practice of communicating with God, expressing dependence, seeking guidance, and [[Word Definitions/Interceding.md|interceding]] for others. It deepens faith, aligns with God's will, and provides spiritual strength and peace.

## What do we pray for?
We pray according to His will. We know this from the Lord's prayer "Your will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven"

## How do we pray in accordance with God's will?
When we pray, we need to ensure that we're praying for God's will to be done. Praying according to God’s will is praying for things that honour and glorify God and/or praying for what the Bible clearly reveals God’s will to be. If we pray for something that is not honouring to God or not God’s will for our lives, God will not give what we ask for.

To start things off - ask for wisdom. The bible tells us that we should ask for wisdom if we lack it ([[Bibles/CSB/59 - James/Jas 1#5|Jas 1:5]]). We also need to make sure there is no doubt when we ask for wisdom. We know that God is good and will answer prayers and we need to understand it's not always how we imagine it will be answered. [[Bibles/CSB/59 - James/Jas 1#6|Jas 1:6]] tells us we need to ask without doubting.

So, praying according to the will of God **includes** asking for wisdom (to know the will of God) and asking in faith (to trust the will of God)

Now that we know we need to ask for wisdom and have faith, how do we know if the things we're praying for are in accordance with His will? For starters, pray for the things for which the Bible commands prayer. This includes things like our enemies, the government, sending us to go into the harvest, relief from affliction, and healing of fellow believers are to name a few. Notice how each of these in some way will bring glory to God if we pray for something positive. Maybe we pray for wisdom and guidance to see the truth for our enemies (we also need to pray the same for us to ensure that we're not inadvertently doing the wrong thing)

Another way is by seeing how others prayed in the Bible. Paul prayed for Isreal's salvation - we should be praying for the salvation of others. David prayed for forgiveness when he sinned - we should be praying for forgiveness and growth from our sins. The early church prayed for boldness - we should be praying for boldness to reach more people.

We need to make sure we have the right motivation for prayer. Are we praying for something to bring glory to God? Sometimes the line is blurred but keep your focus on what ever your praying for that it brings glory to God. Are you out of work and looking for a new job? Ask for peace and and guidance. Not just to calm your nerves but so people around you see that you have a peace about you that goes above "just being calm". It brings glory to God because you are able to show people how he cares for us in times when we're in not the most comfortable situations.

Do not pray out of anger, bitterness, revenge, hatred, or any other of these emotions. Pray out of *forgiveness*. If you are hurt, pray for wisdom and peace and to help forgive those around us. Bring the focus back on the glory of God, and then talk to him.

**This is an answer found on Quora around praying for specific things:**
>What matters is our motivation for what we ask. Are we asking for our own comfort? Selfish requests? Prosperity gospel crap? Do we believe we deserve materialistic things? Or are we praying for things that we will use to advance the Kingdom of Heaven? Even when we think we are being Christian about it, can we honestly face God and say it is for purely selfless and holy reasons we ask?

### Ok, so what IS God's will?
all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth ([[Bibles/CSB/54 - 1 Timothy/1 Tim 2#4|1 Tim 2:4]]). If we're praying for something, that should be our baseline.
## Breaking down the Lord's prayer
The Lord's Prayer, given by [[Jesus]] as a model of how to pray, is a concise but comprehensive prayer found in [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 6#9|Matt 6:9]] - [[Bibles/CSB/40 - Matthew/Matt 6#13|Matt 6:13]]. Here's a breakdown of its parts:

1. **"Our Father in heaven"**: This opening acknowledges God as our Father, emphasizing a personal relationship with Him. It also recognizes God's sovereignty and holiness, as He is in heaven, a place of perfection and divine authority.
    
2. **"[[Word Definitions/Hallowed.md|Hallowed]] be your name"**: To hallow something means to make it holy or to honor it as holy. This line expresses worship and reverence for God’s name, desiring that it be respected and honored universally.
    
3. **"Your kingdom come"**: This is a prayer for God’s reign and rule to be fully realized on earth as it is in heaven. It reflects a longing for God’s perfect order, justice, and peace to prevail over the world’s brokenness and rebellion.
    
4. **"Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven"**: This aligns the person praying to the desires with God’s will, asking for God’s plans and purposes to be accomplished in the world as perfectly as they are in heaven.
    
5. **"Give us today our daily bread"**: This is a request for God to provide for our daily needs, acknowledging Him as the source of all sustenance and provision. It teaches dependence on God for daily sustenance.
    
6. **"And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors"**: This part addresses the need for forgiveness of sins (debts) and the corresponding commitment to forgive those who have sinned against us (debtors). It highlights the importance of mercy and forgiveness in the believer’s life.
    
7. **"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one"**: This is a plea for God’s guidance and protection in facing temptations and evil influences. It acknowledges human vulnerability and the need for divine assistance in overcoming sin and evil.
    

Some traditions include a [[Word Definitions/Doxology.md|doxology]] at the end, "For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen," although this line is not present in the earliest manuscripts of the Gospels. It serves as a final expression of God’s sovereignty, power, and eternal glory.

The Lord’s Prayer encompasses worship, submission to God’s will, dependence on God for daily needs, the seeking of forgiveness, the practice of forgiving others, and the desire for spiritual protection and guidance.

## Do we pray to Jesus, God, or the Holy Spirit?
All prayer should be directed to our [[Word Definitions/Triune.md|triune]] God—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Prayer to one member of the Trinity is prayer to all because they are all God. Jesus assured His disciples that whatever they asked in His name—meaning in His will—would be granted

## What does it mean to pray in Jesus’ name?
Praying in Jesus’ name means praying with His authority (and recognizing it) and asking God the Father to act upon our prayers because we come in the name of His Son, Jesus. Some believe we add "In Jesus' name" to the end of the prayer as a little extra sprinkle of power but we need to understand WHY we pray in Jesus' name.

Jesus tells us in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 14#13|John 14:13]] "What ever you ask in my name, I will do it [...]" but some people mistake this as "I just need to pray this in Jesus' name and it'll be done" but that's not true. They miss the second half which is "[...] so that the Father may be glorified in the Son". 

## TL;DR - The practical section
- Pray according to God's will, his will be done - not ours (that's that all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth)
- In everything you pray for, ensure it's to bring glory to God
- Do not pray for things that are counter to his word
- Always praise and thank God. You can *always* find something to thank him for.
- Pray for wisdom
- We know he hears our prayers **so have confidence in knowing he hears everything you ask for** - it just might not be answered when or how you want because it needs to be according to his will.
- Be honest and open with God, talk to him, and give times of silence to listen for a reply (sometimes not audible, it may come from inside your head)


## Questions
- Are we supposed to ask for things?
	- Yes! What are the motivations behind it though? 
- Is prayer structured?
	- Praying is talking to God. However it's not a bad idea to always thank God and recognize the goodness and grace he's given us before diving into our time with him.
