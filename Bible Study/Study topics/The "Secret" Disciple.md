The concept of a "secret disciple" in the Bible is indeed intriguing and is exemplified by Joseph of Arimathea. Joseph is most notably mentioned in the context of Jesus' crucifixion and burial. Here's what the Bible says about him and the broader concept of secret discipleship.

### Joseph of Arimathea in the Gospels

Joseph of Arimathea is described in all four Gospels (Matthew 27:57-60, Mark 15:42-46, Luke 23:50-53, and John 19:38-42) as the man who provided his own prepared tomb for Jesus' burial. Here are some key points about him:

- **A Wealthy Man and Member of the Sanhedrin:** Joseph was a wealthy individual and a respected member of the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council (Matthew 27:57; Mark 15:43).
- **Secret Disciple of Jesus:** Specifically, in the Gospel of John, it is mentioned that he was a disciple of Jesus but secretly because he feared the Jewish leaders (John 19:38).
- **Bold Request to Pilate:** Despite his previous secrecy, Joseph boldly went to Pilate to ask for Jesus' body, showing a public act of devotion (Mark 15:43).

### The Concept of Secret Discipleship

Joseph of Arimathea's story brings up the concept of secret discipleship, where individuals may follow or believe in Jesus but are not publicly open about their faith due to various reasons, including fear of persecution or social repercussions.

**The Importance of Public Faith:** While the Bible shows understanding towards those who are initially secret in their faith, it also places great importance on public declaration of faith. For instance, Romans 10:9-10 emphasizes confessing Jesus as Lord with one’s mouth as integral to salvation.

### Excerpt from GotQuestions about Joseph

>While there is not much information in the Bible about Joseph of Arimathea, there are certain things we can glean from the text. In [Luke 23:50](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-50.html), we learn that Joseph was actually a part of the Council, or [Sanhedrin](https://www.gotquestions.org/Sanhedrin.html)—the group of Jewish religious leaders who called for Jesus’ crucifixion. However, as we read on to verse 51, we see that Joseph was opposed to the Council’s decision and was in fact a secret follower of Jesus (see also [Mark 15:43](https://www.bibleref.com/Mark/15/Mark-15-43.html)). Joseph was a wealthy man ([Matthew 27:57](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/27/Matthew-27-57.html)), although the source of his wealth is unknown. In addition, the Bible refers to Joseph as a “good and upright man” ([Luke 23:50](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/23/Luke-23-50.html)).  
  
>After Jesus’ death on the cross, Joseph, at great risk to himself and his reputation, went to the Roman governor [Pilate](https://www.gotquestions.org/Pontius-Pilate.html) to request Jesus’ body. [Nicodemus](https://www.gotquestions.org/Nicodemus-in-the-Bible.html), the Pharisee who had visited Jesus at night to ask questions about God’s Kingdom ([John 19:39](https://www.bibleref.com/John/19/John-19-39.html); cf. [John 3](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-chapter-3.html)), accompanied Joseph. The two men were granted custody of Jesus’ body, and they immediately began to prepare the body for burial. Following Jewish custom, they wrapped the body in strips of linen and mixed in myrrh and aloe. However, it was the Day of Preparation—the sixth day of the week, just before the Jewish Sabbath—and it was late in the day. So Joseph and Nicodemus hurriedly placed Jesus in Joseph’s own tomb, located in a garden near the place of Jesus’ crucifixion.  
  
>Unbeknownst to Joseph and Nicodemus, their choice to put Jesus in Joseph’s tomb fulfilled Isaiah’s prophecy spoken hundreds of years before Jesus’ death: “He was assigned a grave with the wicked, _and with the rich in his death_, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth” ([Isaiah 53:9](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/53/Isaiah-53-9.html), emphasis added). This is one of the many prophecies that have confirmed Jesus’ identity as the Messiah and Son of God.
