Born: Uncertain, most likely Jerusalem. Acts 12:12 describes his mother's home in Jerusalem as a meeting place for the early Christians
Died: around 68 AD, possibly as a martyr in Alexandria, Egypt (traditionally believed). 

Fact: Traditionally believed to have been the first Bishop of Alexandria, one of the most important early centers of Christianity. His leadership and efforts are credited with establishing the Christian Church in Egypt, and he is revered as the founder of the Coptic Christian tradition. This role underscores his significant impact on the spread of Christianity beyond the Jewish and Greco-Roman contexts, contributing to the faith's growth in Africa and the development of a unique Christian tradition that persists in the Coptic Orthodox Church today.
