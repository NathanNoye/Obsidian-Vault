## About
Elijah, whose name means "My God is Yahweh," is a significant prophet in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament). He appears prominently in the books of 1 and 2 Kings. Elijah is noted for his zealous advocacy of the worship of Yahweh and his opposition to the worship of the Canaanite deity Baal, which had become popular in Israel under the influence of Queen Jezebel.

## Overview
1. **Prophetic Ministry**: Elijah's public ministry begins in 1 Kings 17, where he prophesies a drought in Israel as a divine judgment due to the idolatry promoted by King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. This drought symbolizes the spiritual dryness and famine due to Israel's apostasy.
    
2. **Miracles**: Elijah performs many miracles, which underscore his prophetic authority and the power of God. These include raising the widowâ€™s son at Zarephath (1 Kings 17:17-24), the contest on Mount Carmel where he calls down fire from heaven to consume his sacrifice (1 Kings 18:20-40), and causing rain to end the three-year drought (1 Kings 18:41-45).
    
3. **Conflict with Ahab and Jezebel**: Elijah frequently confronts King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, challenging their allegiance to Baal and urging a return to Yahweh. After the dramatic encounter on Mount Carmel, where he defeats the prophets of Baal, Jezebel threatens his life, leading Elijah to flee and seek refuge in the wilderness, where he experiences a profound personal encounter with God at Mount Horeb (1 Kings 19).
    
4. **Mentorship and Succession**: Elijah mentors Elisha, who becomes his successor. Before his departure from earth, Elijah parts the waters of the Jordan River with his cloak, reminiscent of Moses' parting of the Red Sea. His ministry concludes with his dramatic ascent into heaven in a chariot of fire, witnessed by Elisha (2 Kings 2:1-12).
    
5. **Theological and Eschatological Significance**: Elijah is seen as a harbinger of the eschatological day of the Lord. His expected return is prophesied in Malachi 4:5-6, which states that God will send Elijah before the "great and dreadful day of the LORD." This prophecy has led to a tradition in Judaism of leaving a chair empty for Elijah during the Passover Seder, symbolizing the expectation of his return.
    
6. **New Testament References**: Elijah is mentioned in the New Testament as well, reflecting his enduring significance. He appears with Moses during the Transfiguration of Jesus (Matthew 17:3), where they speak with Jesus, symbolizing the Law and the Prophets bearing witness to Jesus' fulfillment of both. Elijah is also referenced by Jesus and the apostles to explain and legitimize Jesus' ministry in the context of Jewish expectations.
    

Elijah's life and ministry are characterized by his fervent devotion to God and his role as a restorer of true worship in a time of widespread apostasy and moral decline. His story is not just historical but also offers theological insights into faith, justice, and the power of God's presence and prophecy.

## Why do People think Jesus is Elijah?
The idea that Jesus might be Elijah comes from a combination of Jewish expectations about Elijah's prophesied return and the role of Elijah as a forerunner to the Messiah. This perspective is rooted in the prophecy found in Malachi 4:5-6, where it is stated that Elijah will return before the great and terrible day of the Lord to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the hearts of children to their parents, thus restoring faith and order among the people. This led to a widespread belief among Jews that Elijah would literally return to prepare the way for the Messiah.

Here are a few reasons and contexts in which people thought Jesus could be Elijah:

1. **Messianic Expectations**: At the time of Jesus, there was a strong messianic expectation among the Jews. Elijah, as prophesied by Malachi, was expected to return and herald the coming of the Messiah. Because Jesus came proclaiming the kingdom of God, performing miracles, and calling people to repentance, some people saw parallels with what they expected from Elijah.
2. **Transfiguration**: In the New Testament, specifically during the event of the Transfiguration (Matthew 17:1-13; Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36), Jesus is seen speaking with Moses and Elijah, which could have reinforced the association in the minds of the disciples and others that Jesus was connected to these key prophetic figures, particularly in his role as the fulfillment of the Law and the Prophets.
3. **John the Baptist as Elijah**: The Gospels also suggest that John the Baptist fulfilled the role of Elijah. Jesus himself identifies John as Elijah who was to come (Matthew 11:14, 17:10-13). John came in the "spirit and power" of Elijah (Luke 1:17), calling people to repentance and preparing the way for the Lord. Because of John's identification with Elijah and his direct role in preparing the way for Jesus, some confusion or association might arise about Jesus himself being Elijah.
4. **Public Speculation**: In the Gospel accounts, when people are trying to figure out Jesus' identity, some speculate that he is Elijah returned. For instance, Herod Antipas, upon hearing about the miracles of Jesus, suggests that John the Baptist has been raised from the dead and says, "John I beheaded; but who is this about whom I hear such things?" and others thought Jesus was Elijah (Luke 9:7-8). This speculation reflects the contemporary confusion and expectations regarding prophetic figures and their roles.

Ultimately, while some people speculated that Jesus was Elijah because of his prophetic ministry and the power of his works, Jesus and the New Testament texts clarify that John the Baptist played the Elijah-like role of forerunner. Jesus himself is presented not as Elijah returned but as the Messiah, whose coming Elijah (figuratively in John the Baptist) was to herald.
