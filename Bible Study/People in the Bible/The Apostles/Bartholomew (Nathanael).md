Fact: Recognized [[Jesus|Jesus]] as the Son of God from the very beginning of his discipleship. This is shown in John 1:48 when [[Jesus|Jesus]] says he saw him under the fig tree. [[Jesus|Jesus]] wasn't physically there in person but as God instead seeing him from somewhere else. Nathaneal knew that [[Jesus|Jesus]] must've been God because Nathaneal's reply in verse 49 shows his realization that [[Jesus|Jesus]] is God.
