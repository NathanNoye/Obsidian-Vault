Fact: Little is known about him, and his name varies between the Gospels. He is associated with the patronage of desperate causes. The names he went by were:
- **Thaddaeus**: He is referred to as Thaddaeus in the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 10:3) and the Gospel of Mark (Mark 3:18).
    
- **Jude (Judas) son of James**: In the Gospel of Luke (Luke 6:16) and the Acts of the Apostles (Acts 1:13), he is called Jude, which is short for Judas, the son of James, not to be confused with Judas Iscariot, the betrayer of Jesus.
    
- **Lebbaeus**: In some manuscripts of the Gospel of Matthew, he is referred to as "Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus."
