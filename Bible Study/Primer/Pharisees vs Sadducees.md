The Sadducees and Pharisees were two of the most influential religious groups in Judea during the time of Jesus. Despite both being integral parts of Jewish religious life, they had significant differences in their beliefs, practices, and social roles. Understanding these distinctions is crucial for comprehending the various interactions and confrontations Jesus had with each group in the Gospels.

### Beliefs

**Pharisees:**
- The Pharisees were known for their strict adherence to the Torah, as well as the oral traditions that interpreted and supplemented it. They believed in the resurrection of the dead, angels, and spirits.
- They emphasized personal piety and the importance of following an extensive set of laws covering all aspects of daily life.
- The Pharisees were influential among the common people, often teaching in synagogues and public places.

**Sadducees:**
- The Sadducees were more conservative in their religious approach, accepting only the written Law of Moses as authoritative and rejecting oral traditions upheld by the Pharisees.
- They denied the resurrection of the dead, the existence of angels, and spirits, which set them apart from other Jewish groups at the time.
- Predominantly aristocratic and priestly, the Sadducees were closely associated with the Temple in Jerusalem and the high priesthood.

### Practices and Social Role

**Pharisees:**
- As mentioned, the Pharisees played a significant role in society by engaging directly with the people, which helped them gain popularity and influence among the general populace.
- They were known for their role in synagogues and often had a say in the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council.

**Sadducees:**
- The Sadduceesâ€™ control of the priesthood and the Temple rituals meant they were integral to the religious and social life of Jerusalem, especially during major festivals like Passover.
- They held a significant number of seats in the Sanhedrin, often holding the position of high priest, and were involved in the administration of state affairs.

### Conflicts and Confrontations

- **With Jesus:** Jesus had confrontations with both groups, though His clashes with the Pharisees are more frequently documented in the Gospels. These confrontations often revolved around issues of law interpretation, righteousness, and hypocrisy. For example, the Pharisees criticized Jesus for healing on the Sabbath and associating with sinners, which they deemed unlawful or unrighteous.
- **With Each Other:** The Sadducees and Pharisees also had conflicts with each other, particularly in theological and legal matters due to their differing beliefs and interpretations of the Torah.

### Impact and Legacy

- The destruction of the Temple in 70 AD was a significant blow to the Sadducees, as their religious practice was closely tied to the Temple rituals. They disappeared from history after the Temple's destruction.
- The Pharisees, on the other hand, adapted to the changes post-Temple destruction, focusing on synagogue and community life. Their teachings influenced the development of Rabbinic Judaism, which became the dominant form of Judaism after the Temple period.

In the context of the New Testament, the interactions Jesus had with the Pharisees and Sadducees illustrate broader themes of authority, piety, and the interpretation of Jewish Law, all central to the debates of the time. These interactions highlight the diverse and complex landscape of Jewish religious life during the first century.
