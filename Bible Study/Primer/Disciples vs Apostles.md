In the context of the Bible, the terms "apostle" and "disciple" refer to followers of Jesus but have distinct meanings and roles:

1. **Disciple**:
    
    - The term "disciple" comes from the Latin word "discipulus" meaning "student" or "learner."
    - In the Bible, a disciple refers to anyone who follows Jesus Christ and learns from His teachings.
2. **Apostle**:
    - The term "apostle" comes from the Greek word "apostolos" meaning "one who is sent out."
    - While all apostles are disciples (since they followed and learned from Jesus), not all disciples are apostles.
    - The term "apostle" specifically refers to those who were sent out by Jesus to preach the gospel and establish the church after His resurrection and ascension.
    - The most commonly referred to apostles are the Twelve Apostles, chosen by Jesus Himself. However, the New Testament also refers to others as apostles in a broader sense, like Paul, who was not one of the original twelve but was called to be an apostle to the Gentiles.

The primary difference lies in their roles and calling: disciples are followers and learners of Jesus, while apostles are sent ones with a specific mission to spread the gospel and establish the early Christian church
