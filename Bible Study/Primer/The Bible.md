The Bible is a collection of sacred scriptures or texts held to be the word of God by Christians. It is divided into two main sections:

1. **The Old Testament**: This part is considered sacred by both Jews and Christians, though they arrange the books slightly differently. The Old Testament contains the religious writings of ancient Israel and includes various genres such as history, prophecy, poetry, and law. It tells the story of God's creation of the world, the history of the Israelites as God's chosen people, their laws and moral teachings, and the prophecies about the coming of the Messiah. The Old Testament is written primarily in Hebrew, with some portions in Aramaic.
    
2. **The New Testament**: This section is unique to Christianity and focuses on the life, teachings, death, and resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus]] Christ, as well as the beginnings of the Christian church and teachings of early Christian leaders. It consists of the Gospels, Acts of the Apostles, the Epistles (letters written by early Christian leaders), and the book of Revelation. The New Testament is written in Greek.
    

The Bible serves multiple purposes: it is a source of spiritual guidance, moral instruction, historical account, and theological exploration. It plays a central role in Christian worship, doctrine, and personal faith. Throughout history, the Bible has had a profound influence on art, literature, music, law, and culture.

Christians believe that the Bible is inspired by God, meaning that God guided its authors to write what He wanted communicated, making it authoritative and infallible in matters of faith and practice.
