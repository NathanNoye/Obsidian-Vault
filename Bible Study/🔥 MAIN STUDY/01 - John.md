John's Gospel presents the life, teachings, miracles, death, and resurrection of [[Jesus|Jesus]] Christ, emphasizing His divine nature and love. It delves into His profound relationship with the Father, His offer of eternal life through belief in Him, and His role as the Light overcoming darkness, illustrating His deep, personal connection with believers and His call for unity and love among them.

### Key Themes and Content

- **The Divinity of Christ**: John emphasizes [[Jesus|Jesus]] as the incarnate Word of God (Logos), highlighting his divine nature from the very beginning: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#1|John 1:1]]).
- **Signs and Miracles**: The gospel records several miracles or "signs" performed by [[Jesus|Jesus]], such as turning water into wine at [[Cana|Cana]] (John 2:1-11) and raising [[Lazarus]] from the dead (John 11:1-44). These miracles serve to demonstrate [[Jesus|Jesus]]' divine authority and his role as the Messiah.
- **"I Am" Statements**: John features several profound statements by [[Jesus|Jesus]] known as the "I Am" sayings, where [[Jesus|Jesus]] identifies himself with God, using phrases like "I am the bread of life" (John 6:35) and "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (John 14:6). These statements further underscore his divinity and mission.
- **The New Commandment**: [[Jesus|Jesus]] gives a new commandment to his disciples: "Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another" (John 13:34). This command [[Word Definitions/Underscores.md|underscores]] the gospel's focus on love as central to Christian life and belief.
- **The Holy Spirit**: The gospel also speaks extensively about the role of the Holy Spirit, whom [[Jesus|Jesus]] promises to send as an advocate and guide for his followers after his departure (John 14:16-17, 26; 15:26; 16:7-15).
- **Eternal Life Through Faith**: A major theme is the offer of eternal life to those who believe in [[Jesus|Jesus]]. John 3:16 succinctly captures this message: "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."

### Purpose and Audience

The Gospel of John was written to prove that [[Jesus|Jesus]] Christ is the Son of God and to inspire faith in his name. It is traditionally believed to have been written by John the Apostle, although authorship has been debated among scholars. The exact date of its writing is also uncertain, with estimates ranging from the late 1st century to the early 2nd century AD.

John's Gospel is theological in nature and was written for both Jewish and Gentile audiences, with an emphasis on reaching those who are seeking spiritual truth and understanding. It provides a deep theological reflection on the identity and mission of [[Jesus|Jesus]], making it a profound piece of Christian scripture that has influenced Christian thought and belief throughout the centuries.

The Gospel of John frequently uses contrast as a teaching tool. In chapter 2, there is a strong contrast between the joyous, secretive miracle at the wedding and the angry, ostentatious cleansing of the temple. Chapter three presents another contrast, moving from the loud, public, confrontational temple incident to a quiet, private, instructional conversation with Nicodemus.  
  
Chapter 4 once again presents meaningful contrasts. Nicodemus was a man of power and prestige, well educated, and one who sought out [[Jesus|Jesus]] of his own free will. The Samaritan woman of chapter 4 is poor, outcast even among the outcast Samaritans, and not expecting to meet the Lord at all. Nicodemus needed to be reminded that his knowledge was incomplete ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#9|John 3:9]] - [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#10|John 3:10]]). The Samaritan woman needed to be confronted with her sin ([John 4:17â€“18](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-17.html)) ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 4#17|John 4:17]] - [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 4#17|John 4:17]]), but also lifted up and given value ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 4#23|John 4:23]])

# John 1
**Summary**: John 1 introduces [[Jesus|Jesus]] Christ as the Word, eternally existing with God and as God, emphasizing His divine role in creation and as the source of life and light against darkness. The chapter transitions to [[John the Baptist|John the Baptist]]'s role as a witness to [[Jesus|Jesus]], declaring Him the Lamb of God who takes away the world's sin. It then narrates [[Jesus|Jesus]] calling His first disciples, including Andrew, Simon Peter, Philip, and Nathanael. These initial followers recognize [[Jesus|Jesus]] as the Messiah and Son of God, marking the beginning of His ministry. John 1 sets the stage for the Gospel's exploration of [[Jesus|Jesus]]' identity, mission, and the establishment of His following.

1. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#1|John 1 Verse 1]] and [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#14|John 1 Verse 14]] indicate to us that [[Jesus|Jesus]] is God in flesh. God and [[Jesus|Jesus]] are both one.
2. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#9|John 1:9 ...gives light to everyone...]] - This phrase indicates the universal scope of [[Jesus|Jesus]]' mission. He came to offer enlightenment, guidance, and salvation to all people, not just a specific group or nation. This light is understood as the knowledge of God, the revelation of divine truth, and the path to salvation. It speaks to the inclusivity of [[Jesus|Jesus]]' message and the potential for all humanity to receive divine revelation and understanding through Him.
3. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#11|John 1:11]] - referring to the jews
4. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#13|John 1:13]] - deep dive here in [[ARCHIVED - How do we be "Born of God"?]]
5. [[Andrew]], [[Simon Peter (or Cephas)]], [[Philip]], and [[Bartholomew (Nathanael)|Nathaneal]] are from [[Bethsaida]]. This is a town that could have had a few hundred to a few thousand people and it's likely that Andrew and Philip knew each other.
6. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#23|Verse 23]] is referring to [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 40#3|Isa 40:3]]
7. Nathanael's question "Can anything good come out of Nazareth" ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#46|John 1:46]]) might stem from skepticism and possibly prejudice about the town of Nazareth. At the time of [[Jesus|Jesus]], Nazareth was a small, relatively insignificant village in Galilee, not known for producing prophets, religious leaders, or messiahs. It lacked the prestige of cities like Jerusalem or Bethlehem, which had significant historical and prophetic importance in Jewish tradition. Nathanael's question likely expressed doubt that the Messiah, whom the Jewish people expected to be a powerful and glorious leader, could come from such an obscure and humble place. It underscores a common theme in the Gospels about [[Jesus|Jesus]] defying societal expectations and prejudices, demonstrating that God's plans and purposes often transcend human assumptions about status, importance, and origins.

# John 2
**Summary:** John 2 recounts two significant events early in [[Jesus|Jesus]]' ministry:
1. **The Wedding at [[Cana|Cana]]:** [[Jesus|Jesus]] performs His first miracle at a wedding in [[Cana|Cana]], turning water into wine after the celebration runs out of wine. This act, done at the urging of His mother, Mary, demonstrates His divine power and marks the beginning of His public ministry. It leads His disciples to believe in Him.
2. **Cleansing the Temple:** [[Jesus|Jesus]] visits the temple in Jerusalem during Passover and is angered to find it being used as a market. He drives out the merchants and money changers, asserting the sanctity of His Father's house. This action fulfills a prophecy and signals His authority over religious practices. When questioned, [[Jesus|Jesus]] speaks of destroying and raising the temple in three days, a statement later understood as a prophecy of His resurrection.

These events highlight [[Jesus|Jesus]]' divine authority, His concern for genuine worship, and the beginning of His journey towards fulfilling His mission.

1. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#14|John 2:14]] - "money changers" were individuals who exchanged the various currencies of the many pilgrims visiting Jerusalem for the local currency accepted for the temple tax and offerings
2. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#15|John 2:15]] is when he flipped tables and ran people out of the temple. Why was [[Jesus|Jesus]] so upset about this though? There seems to be more behind this rather than just selling items in the church:
	1. **Desecration of the Temple:** The temple was intended to be a holy place of worship, prayer, and communion with God. The presence of money changers and merchants, especially in the Court of the Gentiles (the outermost part of the temple where Gentiles could come to pray), turned a sacred space into a bustling market, thereby detracting from its spiritual purpose.
    
	2. **Exploitation and Injustice:** The money changers and animal sellers were seen as exploiting those who had come to worship. Pilgrims needed to exchange their foreign currency for the local currency to pay the temple tax and buy animals for sacrifices. Reports suggest that the rates charged were often exorbitant, taking advantage of the pilgrims' need to fulfill their religious duties.
    
	3. **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** [[Jesus|Jesus]]' actions align with prophetic statements about the zeal for God's house and the call for purity in worship. For instance, Psalm 69:9, quoted by the disciples in John 2:17 ("Zeal for your house will consume me"), reflects this prophetic fulfillment.
    
	4. **A Sign of Authority:** Through this act, [[Jesus|Jesus]] asserts His authority over the temple and, by extension, His divine authority to redefine worship and access to God. This event prefigures the shift from temple-based worship to worship in spirit and truth, a theme John develops throughout his Gospel.

	[[Jesus|Jesus]]' reaction is a powerful message against the commercialization of religious practices and a call to honour the sacredness of places of worship. It underscores His role as a reformer and His commitment to the purity of worship.

Does this mean selling items in the church is bad? It depends on the context. [[Jesus|Jesus]]' reaction was a reaction **against** practices that exploited worshippers and desecrated a sacred space meant for prayer and communion with God. The key concerns were the commercialization of religious practices and the hindrance of genuine worship. 

3. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#17|John 2:17]] is a fulfillment of [[Bibles/CSB/19 - Psalms/Ps 69#9|Ps 69:9]]. The disciples recalled this verse, seeing [[Jesus|Jesus]]' actions as a fulfillment of what was written about the Messiah's righteous indignation towards anything that desecrates or dishonours God's house. The "consume me" part is meaning the psalmist is consumed with zeal. In this case with [[Jesus|Jesus]] fulfilling it - he is consumed with zeal over the desecration is misuse of the temple.
4. ðŸ”¥ This parallel blew my mind: [[Jesus|Jesus]] is consumed by zeal when he sees the temple being misused, desecrated, and disrespected. He later says **"Destroy this temple,** **and I will raise it up in three days."** ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#19|John 2:19]]) - this is foreshadowing the resurrection and him becoming the temple. THIS MEANS we should have the same zeal - so much so that we be consumed by it - when we [[Jesus|Jesus]] (the new temple) is being misused, desecrated, and disrespected. 
5. Having zeal involves showing great energy, enthusiasm, and dedication in pursuit of a cause, objective, or activity. In a religious or spiritual context, zeal is often characterized by fervent devotion and vigorous commitment to one's faith and its practices, including worship, service, and the spread of religious beliefs. Zeal is more than just passive belief; it is active and dynamic, driving individuals to engage deeply with their faith, live out their convictions, and make a positive impact in their communities and beyond. [[Jesus|Jesus]] had zeal about the temple and was moved when he saw it being disrespected. If we aren't moved when [[Jesus|Jesus]] (the temple), we need to look into why we aren't affected or consumed.
6. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#23|John 2:23]] seems like it breaks the flow from the other verses (13-22). This is because it is a transitional set of verses where it dives into the more in-depth teachings and interactions that follow in chapter 3. The key point in these three verses is him "entrusting" himself to them. This is what that means: 
	- While people believed in [[Jesus|Jesus]] based on His signs, [[Jesus|Jesus]], knowing their hearts, did not reciprocally commit Himself to them. This indicates [[Jesus|Jesus]]' discernment; He knew that the faith of many was not genuine or deep enough to withstand trials or understand His true mission
	- The passage uses a play on words to contrast the people's belief in [[Jesus|Jesus]] based on miracles with [[Jesus|Jesus]]' reluctance to commit Himself to them. This reluctance stems from His understanding that their belief was superficial, not grounded in a deep understanding of His mission or identity as the Messiah. [[Jesus|Jesus]]' omniscience allowed Him to see beyond outward expressions of belief to the true motivations and stability of their faith. This passage sets the stage for deeper teachings on the nature of genuine faith in the following chapters.
	- This also shows us that we need to have a deep rooted faith in understanding - not just seeing.

# John 3
**Summary** - The first part is a conversation between [[Jesus|Jesus]] and [[Nicodemus]]. This was a very theological conversation since they both knew the law and old teachings VERY well.

This chapter is one of the most important in the entire gospel. Many crucial ideas are explained in this passage, including the role of [[Jesus|Jesus]] as Savior. After the loud, public commotion at the temple, John transitions to a quiet, nighttime discussion. These verses make it clear that Christâ€”and Christ aloneâ€”is the means of salvation for the entire world. This text also states that those who reject [[Jesus|Jesus]] are rejecting God.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#3|John 3:3]] - When [[Jesus|Jesus]] says "Truly, Truly" (double Amen) at the beginning of a statement, he is telling us that the following words are extremely important
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#5|John 3:5]] - water initially thought was water baptism. I wrote a more in depth article called [[Is Baptism needed for salvation?]]
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#6|John 3:6]] - [[Jesus|Jesus]] is re-iterating the concept of the type of births - physical and spiritual 
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#7|John 3:7]] - Nicodemus is surprised and [[Jesus|Jesus]] is noting that with his reply "don't be amazed" - as in "you should know this"

---
# John 4
**summary** - The chapter begins with [[Jesus|Jesus]] leaving Judea for Galilee, choosing to pass through Samaria (which was unusual for Jews at the time due to deep-seated animosities between Jews and Samaritans). In Samaria, He stops at Jacob's well near the town of Sychar. While resting there, He has a profound conversation with a Samaritan woman who comes to draw water. This interaction breaks several social conventions: speaking with a Samaritan, a woman, and someone with a questionable moral background.

[[Jesus|Jesus]] speaks to her about living water, leading to a discussion about true worship and the coming Messiah. The woman recognizes [[Jesus|Jesus]] as a prophet and eventually realizes He is the Messiah. Following their conversation, she becomes a witness to her town, leading many Samaritans to believe in [[Jesus|Jesus]].

After the encounter, the narrative shifts to [[Jesus|Jesus]]' discourse with His disciples about spiritual harvest and His mission. The chapter concludes with [[Jesus|Jesus]] healing an official's son from a distance, demonstrating His authority and power, leading to faith in Him.

> [[Jesus|Jesus]] speaks to a Samaritan woman who is drawing water from a well. [[Jesus|Jesus]] both confronts her about her sin, and comforts her with the truth of the gospel. In particular, He explains that even though He knows her sins, He still seeks after her, and those like her. The woman returns to town, eventually bringing many people to meet [[Jesus|Jesus]]. The disciples, meanwhile, have to be reminded of the purpose of their mission. [[Jesus|Jesus]] also heals the son of a government official in a way that demonstrates the importance of trusting faith, rather than reliance on spectacle.

[[John 4#10|John 4:10]] - One of the core principles involved in evangelism is the idea of "felt need." In short, a person can't act to correct a problem they don't know they have! Here, [[Jesus|Jesus]] is introducing the woman to the fact that she has a spiritual thirst which needs to be satisfied. Later in the conversation, [[Jesus|Jesus]] will be far more direct about the woman's sin. 
[[John 4#19|John 4:19]] - The woman is realizing he is more than just a Jew. The woman is a samaritan so does this show more than just surprise? It seems that even though the Samaritans and Jews didn't get along - that they still knew each other's culture - or at least this woman does.
[[John 4#25|John 4:25]] - The woman is acknowledging there is a Messiah (Christ) coming. [[Jesus|Jesus]] is confirming that is him in [[John 4#26|John 4:26]] 
[[John 4#35|John 4:35]] to [[John 4#38|John 4:38]] is talking about sowing and reaping (planting seeds and harvesting crops from those seeds) but not in terms of food. These passages talk about the following topics:
1. *Recognize the Urgency* -  The harvest is now. Not everyone is ready to harvest but there are those ready now and we need to be aware of it. [[John 4#35|John 4:35]] speaks directly to that in "not waiting for 4 months for when it's ready". It also means there's never a perfect time.
2. *Value Teamwork in Ministry* - One reaps and one sows.
3. *Reap Where You Havenâ€™t Sown* - Sometimes we'll reap and not sow, and sometimes we'll sow but not reap. 37 and 38 both illustrate this
4. *Celebrate the Harvest* - Regardless of what you reaped or sowed - be happy and celebrate because it's for something bigger than you and you've helped make it bigger.

# John 5
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 5#4|John 5:4]] Is not found in some modern translations because it did not appear in the earliest / most reliable manuscripts. It seems to be more of a scribal note.

---
# John 6
There was a big need to feed 5000 people but they didn't have the money to buy the food they needed. A young boy came by with what he had. He wanted to help and offered what he had (we don't know if this was all he had but we know they were about 13km from [[Bethsaida|Bethsaida]] so it would have been a long journey to get more). He gave what he had on hand and God multiplied it. We should give to God with a good heart and trusting in him.

The phrase "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 6#44|John 6:44]]) highlights the concept of divine election or calling. It indicates that an individual's coming to faith in [[Jesus|Jesus]] Christ is not solely an act of human will or effort but involves a supernatural work of God. The Father "draws" people to [[Jesus|Jesus]], meaning He enables and persuades them to come to Christ for salvation. This drawing can be understood as the work of the Holy Spirit convicting people of their sin, revealing the truth of the Gospel, and working faith in their hearts.

People complained following God was difficult and left. Their faith was shallow because they only believed by seeing the miracles. They only believed when God gave them things. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 6#66|John 6 verse 66]] tells us there was many disciples but they turned their back and left. The original 12 stayed because they understood his message. They saw his miracles like everyone else - but they understood his message.

---
# John 7
The pharisees at this point seem to think [[Jesus|Jesus]] comes from Galilee. Nicodemus seems to still believe that [[Jesus|Jesus]] is the Christ. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 7#52|John 7:52]] - the Pharisees seem to snap back sarcastically at Nicodemus saying "You aren't from Galilee too are you?" Basically "Oh you must be God too then!". This same type of confusion can be found in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 7#41|John 7:41]].

---

# John 8
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 8#9|John 8:9]] to [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 8#11|John 8:11]] - This is a great example of how we should be. There's a couple layers to this verse:
- A woman committed a sin yet [[Jesus|Jesus]] does not condemn her. He tells her to go and sin no more. Meaning you may have sinned but I forgive you and this is the point that you turn from that sin (repent).
- "But we aren't supposed to judge!" - This is righteous judgment. [[Jesus|Jesus]] knew this was a sin, so did the woman (or at least it's safe to assume since in that time - this was a well known sin). We should not judge unrighteously. More info here: [[To judge or not to judge]]
- We have all sinned. [[Jesus|Jesus]] told them that if anyone is without sin, they can stone her. None did because we've all sinned. 

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 8#12|John 8:12]] seems like an internal contradiction with [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 5#31|John 5:31]] but it's not when you read the greater context. Let me explain:
- In John 5, there's a portion that talks about having 2 - 3 testimonies (as was customary at the time). [[Jesus|Jesus]] shows us 4 (double what's needed):
	- Himself
	- John
	- The Father
	- The scripture
- In John 8, [[Jesus|Jesus]] mentions 2 testimonies:
	- [[Jesus|Jesus]]
	- The Father
- This is critical because this is also showing his divine authority. [[Jesus|Jesus]] and The Father are one but also two so this makes 2 testimonies.
- Also Testimony and Witness are used in similar ways 

---
# John 9
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 9#21|John 9:21]] - The man who was born blind was of age (meaning 13 in the Jewish tradition) so we can assume he was around that age when the Pharisees questioned him. This is also backed up because they wanted to get his parents but his parents confirmed that he is of age and can speak for himself. This is important because of the conversation that follows.
- The man who was healed seems to have more faith in the Messiah than those who studied for years. You would think they would know the signs and be ready to receive him more than a teenager but the reality was - they were so consumed by so many emotions (whether it's bias, hubris, pride, etc) that they couldn't see the Messiah in front of them
- This is important because we can learn from this. Instead of letting our own bias's get in the way of learning from [[Jesus|Jesus]] - we should instead throw away our bias and try to understand his words.
- Sometimes we misunderstand scripture or we learned scripture from someone else who misunderstood it and that can cause us to put up mental blockers when studying (like how I was looking for confirmation when writing [[ARCHIVED - Is Baptism needed for salvation?]] - I was falling into confirmation bias)
- We see confirmation bias multiple times. The Pharisees had one idea about the Messiah and when [[Jesus|Jesus]] was right there - they couldn't see through their own bias.
- Another fact - the blind man had mud rubbed in his eyes - he was still blind at this point. He had to go into the pool to see. We can assume he was still blind on his journey to the pool - HE HAD TO HAVE FAITH THAT HE WAS GOING TO GET HEALED WHEN HE WENT TO THE POOL. He could have easily turned around and gone home instead but he had faith and did what [[Jesus|Jesus]] commanded. 
- Even if it seems odd, we still need to trust God, have faith, and follow his commands. Having a stranger rub mud in your eyes is a weird thing to have happen - but [[Jesus|Jesus]] is able to do all things and we can trust that it is for our betterment (even if it doesn't seem it at the time)

# John 10
***This is a chapter summary from bibleref.com***

First, [[Jesus|Jesus]] points out that sheep only listen to the voice of their own particular shepherd. They won't listen to a stranger. Spiritually, this explains why men like the scribes and Pharisees don't accept [[Jesus|Jesus]]: they are not part of "His" flock. In prior discussions, [[Jesus|Jesus]] noted that these men are, ultimately, subjects of the Devil (John 8:42â€“47). They don't listen to the voice of God because they are part of some other flock. Unsurprisingly, [[Jesus|Jesus]]' detractors don't get the point (John 10:1â€“6).

The second analogy is relatively brief, but it carries enormous implications. Sheep pens of that era were constructed with high walls and a single narrow opening. This was the only legitimate means of entry or exitâ€”a point [[Jesus|Jesus]] also noted in the first analogy. To control access, the gatekeeper would stand or lay across the opening: he would physically serve as the door. [[Jesus|Jesus]] claims to have that same role, spiritually: He is "the Door," the one and only means by which sheep can enter the pen and find rescue from harm. This is the third of seven times in the gospel of John where [[Jesus|Jesus]] uses the unique phrasing echoing the statement made by God in Exodus 3:14. The world, like sheep, can be divided into only two groups: those "in" and those "out," as defined by "the Door," which is Christ alone (John 10:7â€“9).

Finally, [[Jesus|Jesus]] refers to Himself as the "Good Shepherd," as a contrast to the false religious leaders of Israel. He especially notes His willingness to die for the sake of the flock. Hired hands, as employees, only care for sheep until faced with personal risk. When in danger, they tend to run away. Unlike those false leaders, [[Jesus|Jesus]] is willing to sacrifice Himself to save those He protects. In this comparison, [[Jesus|Jesus]] once again uses the "I am" phrasing. This is the fourth time in the gospel of John where He highlights that theme. His statement also makes a clear, emphatic claim that those who are saved by faith in [[Jesus|Jesus]] are saved permanently, and cannot be lost by any means (John 10:10â€“18).

# John 11
[[Jesus|Jesus]] is fully human and fully God. He feels human emotions because we see that he wept in verse 35.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 11#16|John 11:16]]  Thought that was an odd ending but I looked it up. Itâ€™s a bit sarcastic but also loyal line which I thought was funny. This shows Thomas wasnâ€™t JUST a doubter. He hair strong faith at times and doubted other times, really cool that they noted that

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 11#48|John 11:48]] - Seems like the Pharisees are more concerned with their own well-being than salvation for others. Granted - they didn't believe BUT they knew the signs. They were more concerned about their own well-being than seeing the signs right in front of them. How often are we like this?

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 14#22|John 14:22]] - This is referring to [[Thaddaeus (Jude)]]. There is a part in Mark where it talks about [[Jesus]] calls those whom he desired (and Thaddaeus is one of them)

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 17#5|John 17:5]] - that's so cool

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 17#10|John 17:10]] - Two things here:
- This reminds me of [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#3|John 1:3]] where God has created all things. Literally all things. nothing would be here without him. Everything from the stars to the forks you use to eat. All things come from him - all things belong to him
- If all things belong to him, we should give all things to God. So if you're starting a business, God has blessed you with his creation for you to work within and so you should give your business to him.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 17#12|John 17:12]] - I thought this was the devil but it means Judas Iscariot.
 
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 17#20|John 17:20]] - [[Jesus]] is praying for future believers

# John 18
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 18#6|John 18:6]] - "they" refers to the group of soldiers and officials from the chief priests and Pharisees who came to arrest [[Jesus|Jesus]] in the Garden of Gethsemane. It doesn't tell us exactly why they fell but we can assume it's because they recognized his power. It also could be him saying "I am he", specifically the I AM part.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 18#20|John 18:20]] - Although it doesn't look like there's much beyond the surface, it illustrates how we should be genuine. [[Jesus|Jesus]] didn't said he didn't say anything in secret. We can apply that to not saying anything in secret that would deviate from how we're supposed to be. This doesn't mean we don't pray in secret or anything like that (that's not the context of what I'm saying). [[Jesus|Jesus]] taught and was public and intentional with his words - we should be too. We shouldn't say one thing in public and another in secret - we need to be genuine. Doing this consistently will also change us from the inside and eventually to the outside where we will be living as a genuine person.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 18#36|John 18:36]] - made me think of how if [[Jesus|Jesus]] were the ruler of this world - his followers would fight. Fight what? The enemy. Who's our enemy? The devil and demons and those who do their bidding. This isn't saying we shouldn't fight the devil and demons but made me think. It also made me think on how the devil is the ruler of the world. So using that same logic - his followers are fighting their enemy - us.

# John 19
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#2|John 19:2]] - **Crown** of thorns and a **purple robe** - these were used to mock [[Jesus|Jesus]]. Purple robes indicate royalty and the crown of thorns is double [[Word Definitions/Oxymoron.md|oxymoron]]. One is mocking him by putting a crown on his head with the intention NOT to mark him as king and the other one is the thorns represented sin in Genesis. Ironic.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#23|John 19:23]] - [[Jesus|Jesus]] is not dead yet but he is on the cross.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#29|John 19:29]] - the Israelites used hyssop branches to cover their door frames in [[Bibles/CSB/02 - Exodus/Exod 12#22|Exod 12:22]]

It's fascinating that over some verses - Pilate didn't want to kill [[Jesus|Jesus]] but the Pharisees kept pushing Pilate to do it.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#8|John 19:8]] - Pilate, a gentile, knew the power of [[Jesus|Jesus]] and his authority. Even just by hearing about [[Jesus|Jesus]], not even seeing the miracles, he knew there was more to this man than what others were saying WHILE the Pharisees wanted him dead - the people who should've had all the reasons to know who [[Jesus|Jesus]] was.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#13|John 19:13]] - "sixth hour" in roman times referred to the sixth hour AFTER the sunrise since time keeping started at the time when the sun rose. So this verse is basically saying around 12pm.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#15|John 19:15]] - Interesting passage, looks like 2 things going on. They're manipulating Pilate by playing on his political affiliation. Another perspective is it also looks like they're rejecting heavenly divinity for worldly power. 

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#21|John 19:21]] - They wanted the sign to say that [[Jesus|Jesus]] was self-proclaiming himself as the king of jews but Pilate said that he wrote what he wrote. Why didn't he change it? Could have been he didn't want to, didn't see a reason, or maybe it's a callback to earlier when Pilate became afraid about [[Jesus|Jesus]]' authority in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#8|John 19:8]]. Seems to make sense. The chief priests wanted [[Jesus|Jesus]] to look like he was proclaiming himself and that it's "only him" who sees himself as the king of the jews whereas the sign that Pilate wrote seems to confirm [[Jesus|Jesus]]' kingship and authority (callback to the testimony statements?)

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#31|John 19:31]] - The Sabbath mentioned is referred to as a "special" or "high day" because it coincided with the Jewish festival of Passover. The "Preparation Day" was the day before the Sabbath, on which the Jews prepared for the Sabbath by finishing all work, as no work was allowed on the Sabbath itself.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 19#38|John 19:38]] - caught my eye that he was a "secret disciple" - wrote an article on it here: [[The "Secret" Disciple]]

# John 20
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 20#4|John 20:4]] - Hahahaha "I'm faster than you and everyone's gonna know it forever". [[Bible Study/People in the Bible/The Apostles/John|John]] would be 27 years at this age while [[Simon Peter (or Cephas)|Peter]] would be 32.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 20#19|John 20:19]] - It's unsure if the disciples recognized [[Jesus|Jesus]] but once they saw his hands and side - they did.

# John 21
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 21#6|John 21:6]] - this parallels the first time the disciples didn't catch any fish but [[Jesus|Jesus]] told them to cast their net in [[Bibles/CSB/42 - Luke/Luke 5#4|Luke 5:4-6]]. 

Roger Spoke about this concept once and had this to say about it:

> *I spoke on this about how when we don't feel or see God moving on our lives, we go back to our old habits and they don't work. The Disciples didn't know when [[Jesus|Jesus]] was coming back so they decided to go back fishing. In John 21:3 - the verse tells us they caught nothing JUST like what happened before in Luke 5:5. They didn't know when [[Jesus|Jesus]] was coming to see them so they when back to their old habits. Just then [[Jesus|Jesus]] calls to them from the beach and tells them what to do and they listen. This results in them having abundantly more.*
> 	**- Roger Reid**

I paraphrased a bit but that's basically what he said.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 21#9|John 21:9]] - Callback to [[Jesus|Jesus]] feeding the 5000

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 21#15|John 21:15-17]] - Callback to Peter denying [[Jesus|Jesus]] 3 times, this time [[Jesus|Jesus]] RESTORES Peter 3 times.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 21#19|John 21:19]] - Someone dying a brutal death doesn't seem like it would glorify God **ON THE SURFACE** but dig deeper and you'll see why. Peter died a terrible horrible death and could have renounced God to save himself BUT because of how much he loved God and had faith in him - he chose to follow what he knew was true and die in a horrible way. The reason this glorified God is because it shows how even something is horrible on the surface, Peter had faith until the end. It also showed these traits:
- Faithfulness and Obedience
- Witness to the Gospel
- Encouragement to Believers
- Fulfillment of Prophecy

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 21#20|John 21:20]] - This is John (The disciple [[Jesus|Jesus]] loved). The following verses talk about how Peter shouldn't concern himself with John but rather focus on what [[Jesus|Jesus]] is calling Peter to do.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 21#24|John 21:24]] - Callback to the Jewish law requiring multiple testimonies about someone. This book is a testimony.
