# John 1
**Summary**: John 1 introduces Jesus Christ as the Word, eternally existing with God and as God, emphasizing His divine role in creation and as the source of life and light against darkness. The chapter transitions to John the Baptist's role as a witness to Jesus, declaring Him the Lamb of God who takes away the world's sin. It then narrates Jesus calling His first disciples, including Andrew, Simon Peter, Philip, and Nathanael. These initial followers recognize Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God, marking the beginning of His ministry. John 1 sets the stage for the Gospel's exploration of Jesus' identity, mission, and the establishment of His following.

1. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#1|John 1 Verse 1]] and [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#14|John 1 Verse 14]] indicate to us that Jesus is God in flesh. God and Jesus are both one.
2. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#9|John 1:9 ...gives light to everyone...]] - This phrase indicates the universal scope of Jesus' mission. He came to offer enlightenment, guidance, and salvation to all people, not just a specific group or nation. This light is understood as the knowledge of God, the revelation of divine truth, and the path to salvation. It speaks to the inclusivity of Jesus' message and the potential for all humanity to receive divine revelation and understanding through Him.
3. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#11|John 1:11]] - referring to the jews
4. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#13|John 1:13]] - deep dive here in [[ARCHIVED - How do we be "Born of God"?]]
5. [[Andrew]], [[Simon Peter (or Cephas)]], [[Philip]], and [[Bartholomew (Nathanael)|Nathaneal]] are from [[Bethsaida]]. This is a town that could have had a few hundred to a few thousand people and it's likely that Andrew and Philip knew each other.
6. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#23|Verse 23]] is referring to [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 40#3|Isa 40:3]]
7. Nathanael's question "Can anything good come out of Nazareth" ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#46|John 1:46]]) might stem from skepticism and possibly prejudice about the town of Nazareth. At the time of Jesus, Nazareth was a small, relatively insignificant village in Galilee, not known for producing prophets, religious leaders, or messiahs. It lacked the prestige of cities like Jerusalem or Bethlehem, which had significant historical and prophetic importance in Jewish tradition. Nathanael's question likely expressed doubt that the Messiah, whom the Jewish people expected to be a powerful and glorious leader, could come from such an obscure and humble place. It underscores a common theme in the Gospels about Jesus defying societal expectations and prejudices, demonstrating that God's plans and purposes often transcend human assumptions about status, importance, and origins.

# John 2
**Summary:** John 2 recounts two significant events early in Jesus' ministry:
1. **The Wedding at Cana:** Jesus performs His first miracle at a wedding in Cana, turning water into wine after the celebration runs out of wine. This act, done at the urging of His mother, Mary, demonstrates His divine power and marks the beginning of His public ministry. It leads His disciples to believe in Him.
2. **Cleansing the Temple:** Jesus visits the temple in Jerusalem during Passover and is angered to find it being used as a market. He drives out the merchants and money changers, asserting the sanctity of His Father's house. This action fulfills a prophecy and signals His authority over religious practices. When questioned, Jesus speaks of destroying and raising the temple in three days, a statement later understood as a prophecy of His resurrection.

These events highlight Jesus' divine authority, His concern for genuine worship, and the beginning of His journey towards fulfilling His mission.

1. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#14|John 2:14]] - "money changers" were individuals who exchanged the various currencies of the many pilgrims visiting Jerusalem for the local currency accepted for the temple tax and offerings
2. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#15|John 2:15]] is when he flipped tables and ran people out of the temple. Why was Jesus so upset about this though? There seems to be more behind this rather than just selling items in the church:
	1. **Desecration of the Temple:** The temple was intended to be a holy place of worship, prayer, and communion with God. The presence of money changers and merchants, especially in the Court of the Gentiles (the outermost part of the temple where Gentiles could come to pray), turned a sacred space into a bustling market, thereby detracting from its spiritual purpose.
    
	2. **Exploitation and Injustice:** The money changers and animal sellers were seen as exploiting those who had come to worship. Pilgrims needed to exchange their foreign currency for the local currency to pay the temple tax and buy animals for sacrifices. Reports suggest that the rates charged were often exorbitant, taking advantage of the pilgrims' need to fulfill their religious duties.
    
	3. **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** Jesus' actions align with prophetic statements about the zeal for God's house and the call for purity in worship. For instance, Psalm 69:9, quoted by the disciples in John 2:17 ("Zeal for your house will consume me"), reflects this prophetic fulfillment.
    
	4. **A Sign of Authority:** Through this act, Jesus asserts His authority over the temple and, by extension, His divine authority to redefine worship and access to God. This event prefigures the shift from temple-based worship to worship in spirit and truth, a theme John develops throughout his Gospel.

	Jesus' reaction is a powerful message against the commercialization of religious practices and a call to honour the sacredness of places of worship. It underscores His role as a reformer and His commitment to the purity of worship.

Does this mean selling items in the church is bad? It depends on the context. Jesus' reaction was a reaction **against** practices that exploited worshippers and desecrated a sacred space meant for prayer and communion with God. The key concerns were the commercialization of religious practices and the hindrance of genuine worship. 

3. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#17|John 2:17]] is a fulfillment of [[Bibles/CSB/19 - Psalms/Ps 69#9|Ps 69:9]]. The disciples recalled this verse, seeing Jesus' actions as a fulfillment of what was written about the Messiah's righteous indignation towards anything that desecrates or dishonours God's house. The "consume me" part is meaning the psalmist is consumed with zeal. In this case with Jesus fulfilling it - he is consumed with zeal over the desecration is misuse of the temple.
4. ðŸ”¥ This parallel blew my mind: Jesus is consumed by zeal when he sees the temple being misused, desecrated, and disrespected. He later says **"Destroy this temple,** **and I will raise it up in three days."** ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#19|John 2:19]]) - this is foreshadowing the resurrection and him becoming the temple. THIS MEANS we should have the same zeal - so much so that we be consumed by it - when we Jesus (the new temple) is being  misused, desecrated, and disrespected. 
5. Having zeal involves showing great energy, enthusiasm, and dedication in pursuit of a cause, objective, or activity. In a religious or spiritual context, zeal is often characterized by fervent devotion and vigorous commitment to one's faith and its practices, including worship, service, and the spread of religious beliefs. Zeal is more than just passive belief; it is active and dynamic, driving individuals to engage deeply with their faith, live out their convictions, and make a positive impact in their communities and beyond. Jesus had zeal about the temple and was moved when he saw it being disrespected. If we aren't moved when Jesus (the temple), we need to look into why we aren't affected or consumed.
6. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#23|John 2:23]] seems like it breaks the flow from the other verses (13-22). This is because it is a transitional set of verses where it dives into the more in-depth teachings and interactions that follow in chapter 3. The key point in these three verses is him "entrusting" himself to them. This is what that means: 
	- While people believed in Jesus based on His signs, Jesus, knowing their hearts, did not reciprocally commit Himself to them. This indicates Jesus' discernment; He knew that the faith of many was not genuine or deep enough to withstand trials or understand His true mission
	- The passage uses a play on words to contrast the people's belief in Jesus based on miracles with Jesus' reluctance to commit Himself to them. This reluctance stems from His understanding that their belief was superficial, not grounded in a deep understanding of His mission or identity as the Messiah. Jesus' omniscience allowed Him to see beyond outward expressions of belief to the true motivations and stability of their faith. This passage sets the stage for deeper teachings on the nature of genuine faith in the following chapters.
	- This also shows us that we need to have a deep rooted faith in understanding - not just seeing.

# John 3
**Summary** - The first part is a conversation between Jesus and [[Nicodemus]]. This was a very theological conversation since they both knew the law and old teachings VERY well.

This chapter is one of the most important in the entire gospel. Many crucial ideas are explained in this passage, including the role of Jesus as Savior. After the loud, public commotion at the temple, John transitions to a quiet, nighttime discussion. These verses make it clear that Christâ€”and Christ aloneâ€”is the means of salvation for the entire world. This text also states that those who reject Jesus are rejecting God.

[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#3|John 3:3]] - When Jesus says "Truly, Truly" (double Amen) at the beginning of a statement, he is telling us that the following words are extremely important
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#5|John 3:5]] - water initially thought was water baptism. I wrote a more in depth article called [[Is Baptism needed for salvation?]]
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#6|John 3:6]] - Jesus is re-iterating the concept of the type of births - physical and spiritual 
[[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 3#7|John 3:7]] - Nicodemus is surprised and Jesus is noting that with his reply "don't be amazed" - as in "you should know this"

# John 4
**summary** - The chapter begins with Jesus leaving Judea for Galilee, choosing to pass through Samaria (which was unusual for Jews at the time due to deep-seated animosities between Jews and Samaritans). In Samaria, He stops at Jacob's well near the town of Sychar. While resting there, He has a profound conversation with a Samaritan woman who comes to draw water. This interaction breaks several social conventions: speaking with a Samaritan, a woman, and someone with a questionable moral background.

Jesus speaks to her about living water, leading to a discussion about true worship and the coming Messiah. The woman recognizes Jesus as a prophet and eventually realizes He is the Messiah. Following their conversation, she becomes a witness to her town, leading many Samaritans to believe in Jesus.

After the encounter, the narrative shifts to Jesus' discourse with His disciples about spiritual harvest and His mission. The chapter concludes with Jesus healing an official's son from a distance, demonstrating His authority and power, leading to faith in Him.

> Jesus speaks to a Samaritan woman who is drawing water from a well. Jesus both confronts her about her sin, and comforts her with the truth of the gospel. In particular, He explains that even though He knows her sins, He still seeks after her, and those like her. The woman returns to town, eventually bringing many people to meet Jesus. The disciples, meanwhile, have to be reminded of the purpose of their mission. Jesus also heals the son of a government official in a way that demonstrates the importance of trusting faith, rather than reliance on spectacle.

[[John 4#10|John 4:10]] - One of the core principles involved in evangelism is the idea of "felt need." In short, a person can't act to correct a problem they don't know they have! Here, Jesus is introducing the woman to the fact that she has a spiritual thirst which needs to be satisfied. Later in the conversation, Jesus will be far more direct about the woman's sin.
