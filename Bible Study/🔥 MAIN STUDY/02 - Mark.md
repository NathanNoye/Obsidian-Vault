# Summary
The Gospel of Mark, the second book of the New Testament, is the shortest of the four gospels and is believed to be the earliest one written. It narrates the ministry of Jesus from His baptism by John the Baptist to His resurrection. Mark's Gospel is characterized by its concise and action-oriented narrative, emphasizing the deeds of Jesus more than His teachings. The book begins with Jesus’ baptism, His temptations in the wilderness, and follows with His public ministry in Galilee, where He performs miracles, teaches, and gathers disciples. The narrative then shifts to Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, culminating in His passion, death, and resurrection.

# Key Themes and content
1. **The Messiahship and Sonship of Jesus**: Mark emphasizes Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, revealing His divine nature through His miracles, authority in teaching, and fulfillment of prophecy.
2. **The Kingdom of God**: Jesus' teachings about the Kingdom of God are central, highlighting its present and future reality and how it contrasts with earthly kingdoms.
3. **Discipleship and Following Jesus**: The call to follow Jesus is a major theme, emphasizing the cost of discipleship and the necessity of faith, humility, and self-denial.
4. **Suffering and the Cross**: Mark portrays Jesus' path as one of suffering and service, culminating in His crucifixion, which is presented not as defeat but as the means of salvation.
5. **The Mystery and Misunderstanding of Jesus’ Identity**: Throughout the Gospel, there is a tension between Jesus’ public actions and the private revelation of His identity, which is often misunderstood by the crowds and even His disciples.

# Purpose and Audience
Mark’s Gospel was likely written to a Gentile, possibly Roman, audience. This is suggested by the explanation of Jewish customs (Mark 7:3-4), the translation of Aramaic terms (Mark 5:41; 15:34), and the emphasis on Roman political themes. The purpose of the Gospel appears to be to present the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as the foundation of the Christian faith, emphasizing the importance of belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the saviour of mankind. It seeks to strengthen the faith of the community by showing how Jesus’ life and teachings fulfill God's redemptive plan and to encourage believers to follow Jesus’ example of service and sacrifice, even in the face of persecution or hardship.

# Mark 1 
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#4|Mark 1:4]] - "A Baptism of repentance". Most think this is the exact same as water baptism but it differs *slightly*. This baptism is specifically for repentance and moral cleansing, symbolizing a turning away from sin. Water baptism instituted by Jesus, not only symbolizes repentance but also signifies the believer's identification with Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, marking the individual's entrance into the Christian community and commitment to Christ's teachings

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#8|Mark 1:8]] - Nice contrast. It's interesting reading this knowing that this gospel was written most likely for a gentile audience. It makes the words pop out more.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#22|Mark 1:22]] - Scribes were scholars and teachers of the Jewish Law and were often associated with the Pharisees, but they were not the same. The Pharisees were a religious and political group known for their strict observance of the Law and traditions. While many scribes were Pharisees, not all Pharisees were scribes.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#23|Mark 1:23]] to [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#24|Mark 1:24]] - The "US" statements refer to multiple demons. They recognized Jesus and the power within him.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#30|Mark 1:30]] - This healing is not in John but is in the other gospels. Cool how Jesus just casually heals people. This wasn't in a massive public setting either - it was in a home setting off the cuff.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#44|Mark 1:44]] - The cleansing Jesus is referring to is in [[Bibles/CSB/03 - Leviticus/Lev 14|Lev 14]]. This action also served as a testament to Jesus’ respect for the Law and the proper religious procedures of the time.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 2#19|Mark 2:19]] - Jesus refers to Himself as the "groom" to illustrate the joyful celebration of His presence, akin to the festivity at a wedding. This metaphor is deeply rooted in Old Testament imagery, where God is portrayed as the husband to Israel.

# Mark 3
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 3#28|Mark 3:28]] to [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 3#30|Mark 3:30]] - "The unforgivable sin" isn't what everyone makes it out to be. If you claim the works of God are actually the works of the devil - you are blaspheming. This sin is considered "unpardonable" not because God's mercy is limited, but because it represents a willful and persistent rejection of the truth of the Holy Spirit's testimony about Jesus. If you truly believe Jesus is the Son of God and his works are from God - you're fine. If someone who once rejected or spoke against the Holy Spirit later feels remorse and seeks to repent, the very act of repentance suggests that they have not committed the unforgivable sin in the final sense.

# Mark 4
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 4#12|Mark 4:12]] - Jesus is quoting from [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 6#9|Isa 6:9]] to [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 6#10|Isa 6:10]].

The Parable of the sower explain lists 3 ways the word becomes unfruitful in people's lives:
1. On the path: Satan comes and takes it away from them so we need to **guard it from Satan and hold it close.**
2. In the rocks: It's surface level, it doesn't go deep and affect them deeply. We need to absorb the word and let it grow inside of us.
3. Amon the thorns: We don't trust it. We need to keep our eyes on Jesus and the word and not be swayed by this world.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 4#24|Mark 4:24-25]]  - Jesus emphasizes the significance of attentively listening to and acting upon God's word. He teaches that the effort we invest in understanding and applying His teachings will directly influence the spiritual insight we receive. This reciprocal principle is highlighted: diligent engagement with God’s word yields increased understanding and blessings. Conversely, neglecting or ignoring divine truths leads to loss of even what one has. These verses underscore the necessity of active engagement with scripture to grow spiritually and gain deeper insights into the kingdom of God.

Don't let our hearts be hardened. The disciples let their hearts get hardened because they didn't understand the fish and loaves miracle.
