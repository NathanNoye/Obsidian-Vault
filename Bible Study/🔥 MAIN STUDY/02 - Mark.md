# Summary
The Gospel of Mark, the second book of the New Testament, is the shortest of the four gospels and is believed to be the earliest one written. It narrates the ministry of Jesus from His baptism by John the Baptist to His resurrection. Mark's Gospel is characterized by its concise and action-oriented narrative, emphasizing the deeds of Jesus more than His teachings. The book begins with Jesus’ baptism, His temptations in the wilderness, and follows with His public ministry in Galilee, where He performs miracles, teaches, and gathers disciples. The narrative then shifts to Jesus' journey to Jerusalem, culminating in His passion, death, and resurrection.

# Key Themes and content
1. **The Messiahship and Sonship of Jesus**: Mark emphasizes Jesus as the Christ, the Son of God, revealing His divine nature through His miracles, authority in teaching, and fulfillment of prophecy.
2. **The Kingdom of God**: Jesus' teachings about the Kingdom of God are central, highlighting its present and future reality and how it contrasts with earthly kingdoms.
3. **Discipleship and Following Jesus**: The call to follow Jesus is a major theme, emphasizing the cost of discipleship and the necessity of faith, humility, and self-denial.
4. **Suffering and the Cross**: Mark portrays Jesus' path as one of suffering and service, culminating in His crucifixion, which is presented not as defeat but as the means of salvation.
5. **The Mystery and Misunderstanding of Jesus’ Identity**: Throughout the Gospel, there is a tension between Jesus’ public actions and the private revelation of His identity, which is often misunderstood by the crowds and even His disciples.

# Purpose and Audience
Mark’s Gospel was likely written to a Gentile, possibly Roman, audience. This is suggested by the explanation of Jewish customs (Mark 7:3-4), the translation of Aramaic terms (Mark 5:41; 15:34), and the emphasis on Roman political themes. The purpose of the Gospel appears to be to present the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus as the foundation of the Christian faith, emphasizing the importance of belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the saviour of mankind. It seeks to strengthen the faith of the community by showing how Jesus’ life and teachings fulfill God's redemptive plan and to encourage believers to follow Jesus’ example of service and sacrifice, even in the face of persecution or hardship.

# Mark 1 
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#4|Mark 1:4]] - "A Baptism of repentance". Most think this is the exact same as water baptism but it differs *slightly*. This baptism is specifically for repentance and moral cleansing, symbolizing a turning away from sin. Water baptism instituted by Jesus, not only symbolizes repentance but also signifies the believer's identification with Jesus' death, burial, and resurrection, marking the individual's entrance into the Christian community and commitment to Christ's teachings

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#8|Mark 1:8]] - Nice contrast. It's interesting reading this knowing that this gospel was written most likely for a gentile audience. It makes the words pop out more.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#22|Mark 1:22]] - Scribes were scholars and teachers of the Jewish Law and were often associated with the Pharisees, but they were not the same. The Pharisees were a religious and political group known for their strict observance of the Law and traditions. While many scribes were Pharisees, not all Pharisees were scribes.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#23|Mark 1:23]] to [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#24|Mark 1:24]] - The "US" statements refer to multiple demons. They recognized Jesus and the power within him.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#30|Mark 1:30]] - This healing is not in John but is in the other gospels. Cool how Jesus just casually heals people. This wasn't in a massive public setting either - it was in a home setting off the cuff.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#44|Mark 1:44]] - The cleansing Jesus is referring to is in [[Bibles/CSB/03 - Leviticus/Lev 14|Lev 14]]. This action also served as a testament to Jesus’ respect for the Law and the proper religious procedures of the time.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 1#45|Mark 1:45]] - I wonder if this caused Jesus to not be able to preach to more people or interact with more people. Based on the text, it does seem like there was a negative around the healed leper sharing this news

# Mark 2
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 2#8|Mark 2:8]] - That's so cool. Parallels in John where he said he knew their hearts

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 2#14|Mark 2:14]] - Levi is Matthew: Read more: [[Matthew (Levi)|Levi]] 

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 2#19|Mark 2:19]] - Jesus refers to Himself as the "groom" to illustrate the joyful celebration of His presence, akin to the festivity at a wedding. This metaphor is deeply rooted in Old Testament imagery, where God is portrayed as the husband to Israel.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 2#21|Mark 2:21-22]] are used to show the incompatibilities between His new teachings and Jewish traditions and religious structures.

**Sewing a piece of unshrunk cloth onto an old garment:** When the new patch shrinks after being washed, it will pull away from the old garment, causing a worse tear. This illustrates the tension between Jesus' new teachings and the old Jewish laws and traditions. Just as the new cloth cannot fit well with the old garment, the new teachings of Jesus cannot be simply integrated into the existing religious framework without causing conflict or disruption.

**New wine into old wineskins:** As old wine skins aged, they would become stiff and brittle. New wine, still fermenting and expanding, needed flexible containers to accommodate the gas produced during fermentation. If new wine were put into old, rigid skins, the expanding gas would burst them, resulting in the loss of both the wine and the skins. Symbolically, the new wine represents the new covenant and teachings brought by Jesus, which could not be contained within the rigid and unyielding structures of the old covenant and Pharisaic legalism.

# Mark 3
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 3#28|Mark 3:28]] to [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 3#30|Mark 3:30]] - "The unforgivable sin" isn't what everyone makes it out to be. If you claim the works of God are actually the works of the devil - you are blaspheming. This sin is considered "unpardonable" not because God's mercy is limited, but because it represents a willful and persistent rejection of the truth of the Holy Spirit's testimony about Jesus. If you truly believe Jesus is the Son of God and his works are from God - you're fine. If someone who once rejected or spoke against the Holy Spirit later feels remorse and seeks to repent, the very act of repentance suggests that they have not committed the unforgivable sin in the final sense.

# Mark 4
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 4#12|Mark 4:12]] - Jesus is quoting from [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 6#9|Isa 6:9]] to [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 6#10|Isa 6:10]].

The Parable of the sower explain lists 3 ways the word becomes unfruitful in people's lives:
1. On the path: Satan comes and takes it away from them so we need to **guard it from Satan and hold it close.**
2. In the rocks: It's surface level, it doesn't go deep and affect them deeply. We need to absorb the word and let it grow inside of us.
3. Amon the thorns: We don't trust it. We need to keep our eyes on Jesus and the word and not be swayed by this world.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 4#24|Mark 4:24-25]]  - Jesus emphasizes the significance of attentively listening to and acting upon God's word. He teaches that the effort we invest in understanding and applying His teachings will directly influence the spiritual insight we receive. This reciprocal principle is highlighted: diligent engagement with God’s word yields increased understanding and blessings. Conversely, neglecting or ignoring divine truths leads to loss of even what one has. These verses underscore the necessity of active engagement with scripture to grow spiritually and gain deeper insights into the kingdom of God.

Don't let our hearts be hardened. The disciples let their hearts get hardened because they didn't understand the fish and loaves miracle.

# Mark 8
[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 8#15|Mark 8:15]] - Leaven (yeast) is often used metaphorically to represent an influence that may start small but can permeate and affect a larger whole. Leaven causes dough to rise and change its nature. In a similar way, the teachings or attitudes represented by the "leaven" can infiltrate and influence thinking and behaviour.

# Mark 9

Jesus was transfigured in front of Peter, James, and John and they saw Elijah and Moses talking to Jesus. John refers to this in [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#14|John 1:14]] and so did Peter in [[Bibles/CSB/61 - 2 Peter/2 Pet 1#16|2 Pet 1:16]] to [[Bibles/CSB/61 - 2 Peter/2 Pet 1#18|2 Pet 1:18]]. Wild.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 9#18|Mark 9:18]] - Why couldn't the disciples cast out the demon? Later in verse 29, Jesus says that these only come out by prayer. Some translations say `and fasting` but there's debate. Here's the thing, we know the power of prayer and we know the power of fasting. We know that all power comes from the Holy Spirit and by having a relationship with God, we are empowered by his spirit. Bare in mind the story in [[Bibles/CSB/44 - Acts/Acts 19#13|Acts 19:13-16]] where Jewish exorcists were trying to use the **NAME** of Jesus and Paul. The demon replied saying I know Paul and Jesus but I don't know you. This means the demons know who belongs to God. I'm not saying in this case the disciples weren't known to be from God - but what I am saying is this: Regardless of the translation saying `prayer and fasting`, we know that we need to have faith, we need to have a relationship with Jesus, and both of these grow by following him, keeping his commandments, spending time with him, denying yourself for him (fasting and other things).

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 9#29|Mark 9:29]] - This is similar to Matthew 17:21 (it's not in the CSB since it isn't present in the earliest mss). Some add `and fasting` at the end but there's debate around it.

# Mark 12
One thing to bare in mind is while reading the Gospels - Jesus is usually talking to Jews so any symbols or parables usually go deeper for the Jews than us because we don't have their "cultural lens". For example - the vineyard sounds like it's just a place but it actually represents Israel. Any of the Jews hearing this would pick up on that pretty quick.

The parable that opens this chapter seems to talk about how God has sent multiple prophets and they killed them and then he sent his son and they'll kill him too (present tense of the parable). This is used to illustrate the rejection of God's Son Jesus and that God will kill them and give the inheritance to someone else. If we reject Jesus, we don't get the inheritance. This was also a way that Jesus was telling the Jews of who he was because the vineyard represents Israel.

# Mark 14

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#20|Mark 14:20]] - **Cultural context**: Sharing a meal in the time of Jesus was a sign of fellowship and trust. Dipping bread into a common bowl was a part of the dining practice, and it symbolized a shared life and unity. Therefore, Jesus pointing out that His betrayer is someone sharing the bowl with Him highlights the depth of Judas’ betrayal.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#21|Mark 14:21]] - Why was Judas chosen? Was he predestined?
I don't think so but it is a tough question. We have free will and predestination and free will can't exist together (as far as I know). It is possible that someone else would have taken his place if he had a change of heart. What we know is this was a part of Jesus' plan. To say it was Judas specifically - I don't know but I can imagine it would have been anyone. It's possible that Judas fit the role but the role didn't pick Judas. We know in multiple scriptures that Judas, despite seeing the miracles, was not a believer. He only references Jesus as Rabbi ever after the crucifixion. We know that even while following Jesus that he stole from the money bag.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#28|Mark 14:28]] - Jesus tells his disciples he'll go ahead of them to Galilee. This is cool because the angel tells Mary that he's in Galilee later on. In the moment, they probably thought he would be alive in Galilee in his original form but later we see he's resurrected but the disciples don't recognize him. Is this telling us to drop all bias and just take his words as is? Do we overcomplicate it?

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#38|Mark 14:38]] - Jesus is telling Peter to stay awake and pray. This verse coupled with what happened earlier in [[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#30|Mark 14:30]] is an interesting reminder of how even the strongest can still fall prey to their flesh. "As strong as the weakest link" comes to mind but God is stronger (flesh is weak but spirit is willing). Jesus was asking Peter to be in prayer but he kept falling asleep. What would have happened if he stayed awake and prayed? What we **can** gather from this is we are weak and need to recognize that and come to God not just when we're feeling tempted but also before it even happens. You don't train soldiers for war when the war has started - you prepare in advance.

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#40|Mark 14:40]] - Praying with your eyes open is totally valid

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 14#71|Mark 14:71]] - cursed and swore - really tried to emphasize that he is not with Jesus.

# Mark 15

[[Bibles/CSB/41 - Mark/Mark 15#34|Mark 15:34]] - Did Jesus ask why did God abandon him because Jesus was without sin his whole life and then the sin of the world was put on him separating him from God? Could he not see or feel God because these sins were on him? I want to make sure I fully understand.
