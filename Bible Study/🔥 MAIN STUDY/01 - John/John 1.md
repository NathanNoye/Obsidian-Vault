**Summary**: John 1 introduces Jesus Christ as the Word, eternally existing with God and as God, emphasizing His divine role in creation and as the source of life and light against darkness. The chapter transitions to John the Baptist's role as a witness to Jesus, declaring Him the Lamb of God who takes away the world's sin. It then narrates Jesus calling His first disciples, including Andrew, Simon Peter, Philip, and Nathanael. These initial followers recognize Jesus as the Messiah and Son of God, marking the beginning of His ministry. John 1 sets the stage for the Gospel's exploration of Jesus' identity, mission, and the establishment of His following.

1. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#1|John 1 Verse 1]] and [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#14|John 1 Verse 14]] indicate to us that Jesus is God in flesh. God and Jesus are both one.
2. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#9|John 1:9 ...gives light to everyone...]] - This phrase indicates the universal scope of Jesus' mission. He came to offer enlightenment, guidance, and salvation to all people, not just a specific group or nation. This light is understood as the knowledge of God, the revelation of divine truth, and the path to salvation. It speaks to the inclusivity of Jesus' message and the potential for all humanity to receive divine revelation and understanding through Him.
3. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#11|John 1:11]] - referring to the jews
4. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#13|John 1:13]] - deep dive here in [[How do we be "Born of God"?]]
5. [[Andrew]], [[Simon Peter (or Cephas)]], [[Philip]], and [[Bartholomew (Nathanael)|Nathaneal]] are from [[Bethsaida]]. This is a town that could have had a few hundred to a few thousand people and it's likely that Andrew and Philip knew each other.
6. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#23|Verse 23]] is referring to [[Bibles/CSB/23 - Isaiah/Isa 40#3|Isa 40:3]]
7. Nathanael's question "Can anything good come out of Nazareth" ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 1#46|John 1:46]]) might stem from skepticism and possibly prejudice about the town of Nazareth. At the time of Jesus, Nazareth was a small, relatively insignificant village in Galilee, not known for producing prophets, religious leaders, or messiahs. It lacked the prestige of cities like Jerusalem or Bethlehem, which had significant historical and prophetic importance in Jewish tradition. Nathanael's question likely expressed doubt that the Messiah, whom the Jewish people expected to be a powerful and glorious leader, could come from such an obscure and humble place. It underscores a common theme in the Gospels about Jesus defying societal expectations and prejudices, demonstrating that God's plans and purposes often transcend human assumptions about status, importance, and origins.
