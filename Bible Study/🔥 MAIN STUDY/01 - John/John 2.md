**Summary:** John 2 recounts two significant events early in Jesus' ministry:
1. **The Wedding at Cana:** Jesus performs His first miracle at a wedding in Cana, turning water into wine after the celebration runs out of wine. This act, done at the urging of His mother, Mary, demonstrates His divine power and marks the beginning of His public ministry. It leads His disciples to believe in Him.
2. **Cleansing the Temple:** Jesus visits the temple in Jerusalem during Passover and is angered to find it being used as a market. He drives out the merchants and money changers, asserting the sanctity of His Father's house. This action fulfills a prophecy and signals His authority over religious practices. When questioned, Jesus speaks of destroying and raising the temple in three days, a statement later understood as a prophecy of His resurrection.

These events highlight Jesus' divine authority, His concern for genuine worship, and the beginning of His journey towards fulfilling His mission.

1. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#14|John 2:14]] - "money changers" were individuals who exchanged the various currencies of the many pilgrims visiting Jerusalem for the local currency accepted for the temple tax and offerings
2. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#15|John 2:15]] is when he flipped tables and ran people out of the temple. Why was Jesus so upset about this though? There seems to be more behind this rather than just selling items in the church:
	1. **Desecration of the Temple:** The temple was intended to be a holy place of worship, prayer, and communion with God. The presence of money changers and merchants, especially in the Court of the Gentiles (the outermost part of the temple where Gentiles could come to pray), turned a sacred space into a bustling market, thereby detracting from its spiritual purpose.
    
	2. **Exploitation and Injustice:** The money changers and animal sellers were seen as exploiting those who had come to worship. Pilgrims needed to exchange their foreign currency for the local currency to pay the temple tax and buy animals for sacrifices. Reports suggest that the rates charged were often exorbitant, taking advantage of the pilgrims' need to fulfill their religious duties.
    
	3. **Fulfillment of Prophecy:** Jesus' actions align with prophetic statements about the zeal for God's house and the call for purity in worship. For instance, Psalm 69:9, quoted by the disciples in John 2:17 ("Zeal for your house will consume me"), reflects this prophetic fulfillment.
    
	4. **A Sign of Authority:** Through this act, Jesus asserts His authority over the temple and, by extension, His divine authority to redefine worship and access to God. This event prefigures the shift from temple-based worship to worship in spirit and truth, a theme John develops throughout his Gospel.

	Jesus' reaction is a powerful message against the commercialization of religious practices and a call to honour the sacredness of places of worship. It underscores His role as a reformer and His commitment to the purity of worship.

Does this mean selling items in the church is bad? It depends on the context. Jesus' reaction was a reaction **against** practices that exploited worshippers and desecrated a sacred space meant for prayer and communion with God. The key concerns were the commercialization of religious practices and the hindrance of genuine worship. 

3. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#17|John 2:17]] is a fulfillment of [[Bibles/CSB/19 - Psalms/Ps 69#9|Ps 69:9]]. The disciples recalled this verse, seeing Jesus' actions as a fulfillment of what was written about the Messiah's righteous indignation towards anything that desecrates or dishonours God's house. The "consume me" part is meaning the psalmist is consumed with zeal. In this case with Jesus fulfilling it - he is consumed with zeal over the desecration is misuse of the temple.
4. ðŸ”¥ This parallel blew my mind: Jesus is consumed by zeal when he sees the temple being misused, desecrated, and disrespected. He later says **"Destroy this temple,** **and I will raise it up in three days."** ([[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#19|John 2:19]]) - this is foreshadowing the resurrection and him becoming the temple. THIS MEANS we should have the same zeal - so much so that we be consumed by it - when we Jesus (the new temple) is being  misused, desecrated, and disrespected. 
5. Having zeal involves showing great energy, enthusiasm, and dedication in pursuit of a cause, objective, or activity. In a religious or spiritual context, zeal is often characterized by fervent devotion and vigorous commitment to one's faith and its practices, including worship, service, and the spread of religious beliefs. Zeal is more than just passive belief; it is active and dynamic, driving individuals to engage deeply with their faith, live out their convictions, and make a positive impact in their communities and beyond. Jesus had zeal about the temple and was moved when he saw it being disrespected. If we aren't moved when Jesus (the temple), we need to look into why we aren't affected or consumed.
6. [[Bibles/CSB/43 - John/John 2#23|John 2:23]] seems like it breaks the flow from the other verses (13-22). This is because it is a transitional set of verses where it dives into the more in-depth teachings and interactions that follow in chapter 3. The key point in these three verses is him "entrusting" himself to them. This is what that means: 
	- While people believed in Jesus based on His signs, Jesus, knowing their hearts, did not reciprocally commit Himself to them. This indicates Jesus' discernment; He knew that the faith of many was not genuine or deep enough to withstand trials or understand His true mission
	- The passage uses a play on words to contrast the people's belief in Jesus based on miracles with Jesus' reluctance to commit Himself to them. This reluctance stems from His understanding that their belief was superficial, not grounded in a deep understanding of His mission or identity as the Messiah. Jesus' omniscience allowed Him to see beyond outward expressions of belief to the true motivations and stability of their faith. This passage sets the stage for deeper teachings on the nature of genuine faith in the following chapters.
	- This also shows us that we need to have a deep rooted faith in understanding - not just seeing.
