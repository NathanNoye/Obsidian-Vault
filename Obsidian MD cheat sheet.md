- Use `%% waypoint %%` (but with an uppercase "W") to generate Table of Contents for a folder.
	- The "root" file needs to be the same name as the folder
- Use the command pallet and type "Automatic Table of contents" to insert a table of contents that'll update itself
- Highlight a word, right click, and select "Define This" to create a new definition note for that word
- Click on the Chain icon to find and link all keywords to a specific file (works great with DefineThis)
- You can test code within your notes by creating a code block and viewing it in Reading View.
